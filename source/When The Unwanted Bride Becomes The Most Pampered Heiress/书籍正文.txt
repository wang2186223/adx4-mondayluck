###Chapter 1 You Don't Even Belong In This Family
As the officiant's jubilant words rang out, "Mr. Bryson Hardy, you may now kiss your bride," Marissa Fletcher,adorned in her bridal gown, flung open the doors of the chapel, only to be struck by the sight of her fiancélocking lips with her adopted sister.

This was meant to be the day Marissa and Bryson exchanged vows.

Years prior, the Fletcher and Hardy families had forged a betrothal pact. Bryson, raised overseas by the Hardy family, had lost his sight and hearing in a tragic mishap.Upon his return, it was Marissa who devotedly tended to him, guiding him through his recovery.

He had vowed to give her a splendid wedding once he was completely recovered.

Though Marissa was absent on the day he regained his health, Bryson kept his promise, discussing with the Fletchers and planning their wedding.

Yet, in a hall brimming with guests, Marissa was not the one standing as the bride.

How could this betrayal unfold? "Hold on!" Marissa's voice sliced through the murmurs,capturing every gaze.

The officiant faltered, stuttering, "Why... is there another woman in a wedding dress?"

Undeterred by the sea of curious eyes, Marissa hoisted her gown and marched toward Bryson. "Bryson, I'm the one you're meant to wed, not Evelina!"

Bryson's expression hardened. "Marissa, what nonsense are you talking about?"

"Marissa." Evelina Fletcher's voice quivered, her face ashen. "I know you've always resented me, but today is my wedding to Bryson. Please, wish us well."

"Evelina, don't fear her," Bryson said, stepping protectively in front of her, his eyes cold as they met Marissa's. "Marissa, you're aware of my condition.Evelina cared for me in my darkest time. In honor of our families' old engagement, I've decided to marry her.She's also a Fletcher daughter, after all."

"Cared for you? I'm the one who nursed you back to health!" Marissa cut in, incredulous. "Are you out of your mind? When was Evelina ever betrothed to you?She is just an adopted daughter!"

"That's enough!" Susanna Fletcher, Marissa's mother,stormed forward, her hand striking Marissa's cheek with a sharp slap. "Evelina is our true daughter. You've
stolen her life, and now you dare cause a scene?"

Marissa clutched her burning face, staring at her mother in disbelief. "Mom, what are you saying? How could Evelina be..."

Her words trailed off as painful memories washed over her.

Though raised as a Fletcher, Marissa had been denied the warmth of her parents. She treaded carefully,offering respect to her stern parents, never daring to get too comfortable at home.

Her mind drifted back to the day she first met Evelina-it was at a crowded train station.

Evelina was quarreling with a man, accusing him of betraying her after they had moved to the city.

When the man grew violent, Marissa instinctively intervened. Instead of gratitude, she found Evelina clutching her arm desperately, pleading for a chance to work in exchange for food.

Pressed for time and overwhelmed by her own packed schedule, Marissa reluctantly took her home.

Not long after, her mother cheerfully announced that Evelina had been adopted into their family.

From that moment, Evelina became the center of attention, the darling of the Fletcher household, while
Marissa was quietly sidelined.

Evelina's shy and fragile demeanor only deepened their parents' affection. They even dismissed the maid and took up cooking themselves, despite their utter lack of talent. Somehow, this duty fell to Marissa.

Evelina soaked up the affection Marissa never received and freely tapped into the Fletcher family's wealth.

She effortlessly gained admission to the elite university Marissa had toiled to enter and mingled at gatherings using Marissa's hard-won social ties.

Such moments were endless.

In her innocence, Marissa once believed that by giving in to Evelina and tending to her needs, she might win her parents' affection.

Now, the harsh reality unfolded before her. Her tireless efforts never earned their love because she was not their true daughter.

How ridiculous it all seemed!

"Marissa, I'm so sorry," Evelina said, her eyes brimming with tears, her voice trembling with feigned remorse."It's my fault, but you've had my parents all these years. Bryson and I... we're truly in love. If you're hurt,I..."

Marissa gazed at the seemingly innocent woman, a wry
smile on her lips. "If I'm hurt, what then? Will you step aside and let me marry Brysdn?"

Her words carried a heavy edge, which Evelina took as bitterness.

"You!" Evelina's face brefly contorted before she restrained herself, glancing at her beloved. Her tone,stripped of its usual softness, turned sharp. "Marissa,get this straight-he is my fiancé, not yours! You don't even belong in this family."

"So Marissa wasn't even their real daughter? Evelina's the real Fletcher?"

"Marissa is shameless, taking Evelina's place and now trying to snatch her man!"

The guests' murmurs swirled around Marissa.

Her face grew somber as she turned to Susanna,her voice faltering. "Mom, am I truly not your daughter?"

Susanna's expression twisted with disdain, her words cutting like a blade. "You two were switched at birth. If your despicable parents hadn't sold Evelina and let you steal her place, she wouldn't have endured such suffering all these years!"

A crushing wave of anguish overwhelmed Marissa,rooting her to the spot.

"I wanted you to witness Èvelina's happiness before
quietly leaving," Susanna sneered, her demeanor arrogant. "But since you're so ungrateful, you are no longer welcome here. And just so you know, your destitute parents have found you a husband; he's waiting outside."
###Chapter 2 She Proves Utterly Ungrateful
Marissa was stunned. Her real parents had found her a husband?

She clenched her fists tightly, a cold dread seeping into her chest as the realization dawned.

Had her parents, whom she had never met,already started plotting her future behind her back?

"Marissa, try not to worry too much-living in the rural area isn't nearly as tough as it might seem. With diligent effort, you will manage to get by, plus you'll have affectionate parents watching over you. Your life will be so much better than mine was. I was forced to plead for mercy from those human smugglers..."Evelina murmured, her gaze lowered while tears trickled down, stirring feelings of pity in observers.

"My poor daughter," Susanna sobbed, embracing Evelina closely, her eyes shooting daggers of fury toward Marissa. "Get out of here right this instant,Marissa! I can't stand the sight of you!"

Marissa tightened her lips before addressing Bryson with measured emphasis, "Mr. Hardy, even if Evelina is the real daughter of the Fletcher family, you are
mistaken about one thing: it was I who nursed you back to health."

Bryson scowled in revulsion. "Although I lacked sight and hearing previously, my remaining perceptions were acute.I remembered that the woman who cared for me had a mark on the back of her left hand, identical to Evelina's. How on earth could I confuse that? Marissa,you've enjoyed a life of opulence within the Fletcher household-how would someone like you acquire such a scar? You can't fool me. Kindly cease this nonsense."

Marissa let out a wry chuckle.

She lifted her left arm and stripped away the glove,displaying an unblemished hand.

There was meant to be a mark there. It stemmed from an accident when she first attempted cooking and mishandled the stove, resulting in a significant burn scar. Susanna had insisted she keep it as a lesson, and Marissa typically concealed it with a glove for aesthetic reasons.

However, during her time tending to Bryson and administering treatments, she never wore the glove.

For this wedding ceremony, symbolizing a farewell to her former life, Marissa had at last eradicated that scar from her skin.

Yet, she never foresaw it would deprive her of the
opportunity to validate her actions.

Bryson eyed her revealed hand with a mocking smirk,then seized Evelina's left hand, yanking off her glove against her protests, exposing a grotesque scar.

The lesion appeared inflamed, oozing with fluid and blisters, presenting a repellent sight.

It was a fresh thermal injury, not an old burn, destined to heal and fade within days.

Marissa's attention shifted to Susanna, who averted her face in discomfort.

Susanna's tone wavered as she declared, "Evelina's scar can be corrected through plastic surgery in the future. She ought not to bear any disfigurements."

Marissa erupted in derisive laughter.

The truth became crystaI clear.

Susanna was aware that Marissa had attended to Bryson, yet she deliberately attributed the merit to Evelina.

Marissa cast a final glance at the individuals she had once regarded as family and beloved.

There was Evelina's triumphant gleam, Susanna's look of repulsion, her husband Phil Fletcher's feigned helplessness,and Bryson's irritation...
Marissa realized she was a bigger fool than Bryson.

She pivoted and descended the steps, observing that her bridal gown's edge dragged excessively. Without hesitation, she ripped it decisively, hiking the cumbersome skirt up to her knees.

Displaying an impassive face, Marissa exited the hall,resolute in her resolve.

Given that the Fletcher family had never truly accepted her, and Bryson firmly believed Evelina to be hissavior,then every advantage and initiative she had facilitated for both the Fletcher and Hardy families would be revoked.

Susanna observed Marissa's departure, her forehead creased in contempt. "After all the effort we invested in nurturing her, she proves utterly ungrateful. She is incomparable to Evelina!"

As Marissa proceeded out of the venue, murmurs trailed her, but she paid them no heed, advancing directly to the front gate.

The primary doorway stood vacant, save for the security guard engaged in a call. "I've already explained, entry isn't open to just anybody. This is a premium matrimonial site. Quit bothering me!"

After disconnecting, the guard spotted Marissa and remarked scornfully, "Aren't you the impostor from the
Fletcher family? Your real parents just reached out,instructing that you remain here for a pickup. I'm confused about why they're asking if there's ample parking room. How massive could their vehicle be? Are they showing up in some rickety truck?"

Just as the guard concluded, a sleek black elongated Lincoln screeched to a halt directly before Marissa.
###Chapter 3 Are You Dissatisfied With Me

The car window slid down with a quiet hum, revealing a man whose features were so perfectly defined they almost seemed unreal.
Marissa froze-it was Theodore Brooks, the current head of the Brooks family.

The Brooks family was not just influential-it was one of the most powerful families in the region, their reach extending across industries and politics. For someone of his stature, who was constantly buried in high-level affairs, to appear here in person was almost unimaginable.

"Get in."
His voice was smooth and pleasant, yet completely devoid of warmth-a tone that carried authority rather than invitation.

The car door clicked open from the inside.

Marissa blinked, thinking she must have misheard him.She instinctively pushed the door shut again and forced a polite smile. "Thank you, but I'm waiting for someone."
A brief flash of surprise crossed Theodore's otherwise expressionless face. His eyes lingered on her composed expression before he replied flatly, "I'm the one you're waiting for."

When Marissa still didn't move, hereached into the seat beside him, picked up a document, and extended it toward her. His brows knit slightly, his tone remaining detached."Take a look."

Her gaze lingered on his face for a moment before she finally accepted the document.

She had always disliked the artificial scent of cologne on men, yet the faint cedarwood fragrance he wore was unexpectedly calming-clean, understated, and oddly magnetic.

Almost without realizing it, Marissa opened the door and slid into the seat beside him.

The interior was refined and luxurious, its quiet elegance matching its owner perfectly. As the car moved, Marissa stared down at the report in her hands -her eyes scanning the pages again and again. A DNA test.

Her throat tightened. It turned out she was the real daughter of the Curtis family!

The Curtis family was renowned across Ariolens for their vast fortune and humanitarian work. They owned
Corelight Pharma, the nation's largest pharmaceutical company, and had built countless charitable foundations. They were also always the first to offer help in any crisis. They were a name synonymous with power and generosity.

In comparison, the Fletcher family, who had raised her,was insignificant.

And yet, they had sneered at her, insisting her biological parents were from the slums.

The irony almost made Marissa laugh aloud.

Her lashes trembled slightly as she lowered her head,her slim fingers tapping lightly against the document.After a long pause, she finally asked, her voice calm but edged with amusement, "So... are you the husband my real parents arranged for me?" A hint of mischief played in her tone, as though she found the entire situation absurd.

If the Fletchers ever discovered that the supposedly "lowly" parents they mocked had arranged for her to marry the powerful Theodore, they would probably lose their minds.

Her casual, almost teasing attitude rubbed Theodore the wrong way.

He turned his head, studying her closely. She sat there with her chin resting on her hand, the sunlight filtering
through the window and dancing in her eyes, turning them into pools of quiet defiance. Something about her didn't match the calm, docile image he had been led to expect from her file.

After a moment, his voice dropped a few degrees colder. "Are you dissatisfied with me?"
###Chapter 4 Quite The Obedient Daughter, Aren't You


Theodore didn't look away for even a second. His gaze stayed locked on Marissa's face, as though he were trying to read something hidden beneath her calm expression.

"My parents arranged our marriage, so my opinions don't matter," Marissa answered plainly. She held his gaze with quiet confidence, her lips curving into a faint,composed smile.

Theodore's eyes were dark and hard to read, giving nothing away. He lifted an eyebrow, but his tone stayed cool and detached.

"You seem to have accepted your arranged marriage without much resistance. Quite the obedient daughter,aren't you?" he remarked.

Obedient daughter?

Marissa's fingers stilled, and her brows drew together slightly. A sharp glimmer flickered in her clear eyes as she replied softly, "You're one to talk, Mr. Brooks."

Both of them kept their faces neutral as they locked eyes, neither one ready to back down. The silence
between them was thick with tension.

The car was spacious but still too confined for comfort.When Theodore shifted slightly, the scent of cedar around him intensified, filling the air and surrounding her. She tried breathing through her mouth but then caught another faint scent beneath the cedar...something faintly metallic.

It took her a moment to realize it was the scent of blood.Was he hurt?

Her eyes moved to his face, stopping briefly at his tightly pressed lips before she realized she'd been staring.

"You..." she began, unsure how to ask.

The moment she spoke, his expression turned cold and severe.

The sudden change made her hesitate, but just as quickly, his features softened again.

Completely unpredictable!

That was the only conclusion Marissa could come to about his ever-changing moods

"Never mind. It's nothing," she said lightly, leaning back as if the conversation no longer mattered.

She appeared relaxed, but every muscle in her body
was on alert. From the corner of her eye, she watched Theodore, who seemed disinterested in continuing the talk. After a moment, she closed her eyes, pretending to rest, though her mind stayed sharp and wary.

"Forget it. He probably just used perfume to mask the scent of his injury. There's no point in calling him out on it,"she mused.

Theodore looked at her for a moment, his eyes tracing the calmness on her face. Then, with a crease in his brow, he turned away and closed his eyes as well.

"Mr.Brooks?"

The voice of Wilbur Howe, Theodore's assistant, came from the front seat as he tapped lightly on the partition.

Theodore opened his eyes and pressed a button,lowering the divider between them.

"Miss Fletcher," Wilbur greeted politely before turning to Theodore. His usual calm demeanor shifted to something more serious. "We've just received information that Dr. Moore vanished after arriving in Ozreka."

Marissa had planned to tune out the conversation completely. But the moment she heard the name Dr Moore,her composure cracked, and her eyes widened briefly in surprise.
She quickly recovered, turning her head toward the window, wearing a look so composed it was almost cold, as if none of it mattered to her.

Still, while the two men spoke, she quietly listened,every word of Wilbur's report to Theodore reaching her attentive ears.

She believed her small reaction had gone unnoticed,but Theodore had seen it. The quck flash in her eyes when Dr. Moore's name came up hadn't escaped him.

Why did she react like that? Had she heard of Dr.Moore?

According to rumors, Dr. Moore was a man with miraculous medical skills, but he was elusive. It was highly unlikely she knew him.

Theodore didn't let his thoughts show, keeping his gaze steady ahead. But deep down, his interest in Marissa grew stronger.
###Chapter 5 Welcome Back Home


Marissa rolled the window down a little, letting the cool breeze brush against her face. Just then, a blue Bugatti sped past-a car so rare and expensive it made heads turn even in this upscale area.

Their black sedan continued through the elegant villa district, where luxurious homes lined the lakeside, each one more impressive than the last.

When the car stopped in front of two neighboring villas, Marissa noticed five men waiting outside. All of them were good-looking, their eyes lighting up the moment they saw her.

"Marissa,welcome home."

The greeting came in perfect unison, warm and full of excitement.

One of the men stepped forward with a welcoming smile and began introducing them one by one. "This is your eldest brother, Marc Curtis. Next is Zachary, your second brother. Then there's Danny, youur third brother,and Timothy, your fourth. And as for me," he added with a light grin, "I'm your fifth brother, Andrew."

"Marissa, welcome back home." Marc spread his arms
wide,his expression gentle and affectionate.

Before she could respond, Andrew jumped in,wrapping her in a hug. "Hey! I saw her first! The first hug should be mine!"

Marc laughed and shook his head, lowering his arms good-naturedly. Then, his eyes moved past Andrew and landed on Theodore, who had just stepped out of the car. "It's been a while, Theodore," Marc greeted,walking over.

The scene was filled with cheerful energy and warmth,the Curtis brothers happily crowding around their sister. In contrast, Theodore stood quietly to the side,calm and detached, as if the lively atmosphere had nothing to do with him.

"Must've been about half a year since we last met,huh?" Marc said, noticing Theodore's reserved expression. Could it be that Theodore had not said a single word to Marissa during their drive here?

"Marc! Enough small talk" Andrew interrupted. "The most important thing today is that our sister's finally home! Come on, let's go inside."

Theodore didn't follow them. "I have some matters to take care of," he said simply. "Now that she's here safely, I'll be heading out."

Marc frowned but didn't push further. "Alright then.
We'll catch up next time."

Theodore gave a short nod, his eyes flicking briefly toward Marissa. "I'll take my leave now."

Caught off guard, Marissa hesitated, then waved awkwardly. "Oh, okay. Goodbye."

"Come on, Marissa! Mom and Dad are already waiting inside," Andrew said, taking her hand and leading her into the villa.

Just then, a soft, frail voice echoed from inside. "Is...is my daughter back?"

That gentle tone carried both warmth and weakness,followed by a harsh, painful cough that filled the silent hall.

"Quick! Get some water and her medicine!"

The maids, dressed neatly in light brown uniforms,rushed to help, moving quickly and quietly.

Andrew and Marc guided Marissa further into the main hall.

Marc frowned, his tone sharp. "Didn't we agree to wait until we got inside before telling her?"

His words made the butler nearby break into a nervous sweat.

Their mother, Corrine Curtis, took the glass of water
from a maid and waved off Marc's concern. Tears glistened in her eyes as she turned her gaze toward Marissa.

The resemblance between her and her sons was unmistakable. The Curtis brothers were undeniably handsome, and their mother's beauty had once been just as breathtaking. In her youth, Corrine had been radiant, like a flower at its peak, and even with the passing years, her charm hadn't faded. There was still a natural grace about her, soft yet dignified, the kind that drew people in effortlessly.

"Marissa!" Corrine's voice trembled, her tears finally spilling over. They rolled down her pale, delicate cheeks as she tried to move the wheelchair herself, too impatient to wait for help.

Marissa stood frozen as the chair slowly came to a stop in front of her.

The air around them seemed to still. Finally, she crouched down, lowering herself to meet the woman's eyes.

Corrine whispered, her voice breaking with emotion,"It's been nineteen years. I've finally found you."
###Chapter 6 I Never Wanted To Lose You
Corrine's eyes were swollen and red as she looked at Marissa, her long-lost child finally standing before her.Her voice trembled, breaking between sobs. "I missed you so much... so, so much, Marissa."

Unable to hold it in any longer, she reached forward and pulled Marissa tightly into her arms.

From the moment Marissa had stepped into the Curtis family's villa, the warmth and affection surrounding her had felt almost foreign. She wasn't used to this kind of welcome. It made her uneasy, yet at the same time,she couldn't help but feel drawn to it.

Within seconds, Corrine's tears had soaked through Marissa's shoulder. Marissa lowered her gaze, feeling a hot sting in her own eyes. She hesitated, then slowly raised her hand and placed it on her mother's back.

That simple gesture made Corrine's heart leap. She cupped Marissa's face and asked softly, "Did the Fletcher family treat you well all these years?"

"They were... strict. But I managed," Marissa replied.

She wasn't good at pretending, and honestly,she saw no reason to lie. There was no point in defending
people who had never truly cared for her.

Corrine instantly understood the truth behind those few words, but she was too overwhelmed to respond.Overcome with emotion, she clung to Marissa so tightly that Marissa had to brace herself to stay upright.

"Be careful!"

One of the Curtis brothers called out, ready to help.But before they could move, they saw Marissa easily lift their frail mother and set her gently into the wheelchair.

All five brothers stared in surprise. Who would've guessed their sister was that strong?

Had the Fletcher family really made her do all the heavy lifting and rough chores all these years?

"You're amazing, Marissa," Corrine exclaimed,her voice overflowing with pride and tenderness.

But then, her smile faltered. Her gaze dropped to Marissa's skirt that was torn at the edge, and her expression instantly changed. Tears fell from her eyes,landing on her pale, trembling hand as she gripped the fabric. "Did the Fletcher family do this to you?"

Marissa shook her head. "No."

Though her reply was quiet, Corrine didn't believe it for
a second.

A mother's heart knew the truth. There was no warmth in Marissa's tone, no fondness when she spoke of them. The absence of any emotion was proof enough of the coldness she must have endured all these years.

"Marissa, are you upset with me?" Corrine's usually steady voice wavered as she spoke. The woman who had always carried herself with confidence couldn't even lift her eyes to meet her daughter's. "I never meant to leave you back then. I'm sorry, sweetheart.I never wanted to lose you."

Her words came out broken, carried by the weight of years of regret.

Marissa lowered her head slightly, her gaze meeting Corrine's tearful eyes. After a brief pause, she answered softly, "I know."

Because who in their right mind would ever choose to lose their own child?

"How did you find out I am your daughter?" Marissa asked.

The Fletcher family had described her real family as lowly and despicable, a far cry from the dignity of the powerful Curtis family.

Corrine's eyes shimmered with guilt as she gently took
her daughter's hand. "We have Theodore to thank for that," she said tenderly.

"Theodore?" Marissa blinked, surprise flickering in her eyes.

Corrine nodded. "You might not remember, but you and Theodore met once before. He said he saw you at a business event and thought you looked a lot like our family."

"Oh, I see." Marissa's voice carried no particular interest, just mild politeness.

Sensing her disinterest, Corrine quickly shifted the conversation and guided her towards the walk-in closet."I've had so many clothes and pieces of jewelry prepared for you. After all these years, you finally get to have them."

She had originally planned to give Marissa time to adjust, to let her ease into this new life slowly. But seeing her daughter's torn skirt earlier had made her realize she might have underestimated how much hardship Marissa had endured.

Still, Marissa wasn't one to talk much. Most of Corrine's attempts to engage her had been met with short, almost emotionless replies. It made her hesitate,afraid of pushing too hard.

"Would you like me to stay with you a little while
longer?" Corrine asked tentatively. She longed to be near her daughter, but she also didn't want to make her uncomfortable. Marissa was an adult now, and Corrine didn't want to intrude.

Marissa understood what Corrine was thinking. She offered her mother a reassuring smile. "You should rest for a bit. I'll be fine."

Corrine's heart sank for a moment, but when she saw the small gesture of concern behind those words, her disappointment softened into warmth. "Alright. If you need anything at all, just call me."

"Okay." Marissa nodded and helped push her mother's wheelchair out of the walk-in closet.

Once outside, Corrine's expression changed. She turned to Marc, her tone calm but edged with concern."Marc, why didn't Theodore come back with Marissa?"
###Chapter 7 She's Here To Take What Rightfully Belongs To You


Marc calmly explained to Corrine that Theodore had left early because of other obligations. After a pause,he added carefully, "Mom, to be honest, I don't think the Brooks family is that invested in this marriage.There are plenty of respectable young men here in Ozreka who'd be a better match for Rissa. Maybe we should consider someone else?"

Corrine's expression shifted, caught between surprise and confusion. "Theodore isn't happy about the marriage?" she asked. "But didn't the Brooks family say he agreed to it himself?"

The Curtis and Brooks families were bound by a marriage alliance.

When Marissa went missing all those years ago, her stepgrandmother had even tried to replace her with another girl, though Corrine and her husband had fiercely opposed the idea. The Brooks family refused the replacement outright, insisting they would wait until the Curtis family head's daughter was found. Only then could the marriage arrangement be resumed.

Before Corrine could continue, a loud commotion
erupted downstairs.

"Where is she? I've never seen someone so shameless!She's barely back home and already causing trouble!|don't recognize her as a Curtis. Who does she think she is? Bring her down here right now!"

Upstairs, inside the cloakroom, Marissa's tone was calm but firm as she spoke into the phone. "I'll treat him on one condition: I choose the venue. Make sure they understand that. That's all. I have something to deal with now, so we'll talk later."

As soon as she hung up, a sharp knock sounded at the door.

"Miss Marissa Curtis! Are you inside? Mrs. Rita CCurtis and Miss Holley Curtis have arrived! They're waiting to see you downstairs. Please come at once."

The butler's voice rang out, slightly too loud and almost eager.

Marissa didn't rush. She picked up a silver-gray suit jacket, slipped it on, and opened the door.

The butler, who had been smirking to himself a moment ago, froze when she appeared. His confident look faltered into awkwardness as he quickly lowered his head and stepped aside to clear her path.

Marissa didn't bother acknowledging him. Her heels
clicked lightly against the floor as she descended the grand staircase.

Just before she could reach the bottom, a disdainful voice rose from below. "So, you're Marissa?"

Marissa's gaze dropped, landing on the older woman lounging confidently on the couch below.

Dressed in lavish jewelry that gleamed under the light,she exuded an air of arrogance and self-importance.It was none other than Rita Curtis.

"Are you deaf?" she sneered. "You see me and can't even say hello?"

Despite all the glittering jewels she was wearing, there wasn't a hint of grace about her, but just pure arrogance.

The warmth Marissa had felt from her mother and brothers only moments ago had started to ease her guard, but Rita's words quickly built those walls back up again.

She remembered the file Theodore had once shown her, the report listing every living member of the Curtis family. She hadn't had time to study it thoroughly, but one name had caught her eye-Rita Curtis, her grandfather Hank Curtis's second wife.

"Raised in such humble surroundings, no wonder you
lack proper manners," Rita remarked, her eyes narrowing as Marissa came closer. The faint resemblance Marissa shared with Corrine seemed to fuel her dislike even more.

Next to Rita sat a young woman leaning affectionately against her shoulder-Holley, Marissa's cousin. She tilted her head and, with an innocence that was more mocking than sweet, asked, "Does she really not speak? That's kind of sad."

The scene brought an unpleasant sense of déjà vu to Marissa. The dynamic between Rita and Holley reminded her far too much of Susanna and Evelina.

"Sad? What's sad about her?" Rita scoffed. "Don't waste your pity on her. She's here to take what rightfully belongs to you."
###Chapter 8 Let's Not Make Things Awkward Between Family


Holley's eyes swept over Marissa's flawless features,and jealousy twisted in her chest. That calm and beautiful face made her feel small in comparison. "Rita,don't be so harsh with Marissa. She's our family," she said sweetly, throwing Marissa a quick, teasing wink.

Rita's expression hardened instantly. "I refuse to accept someone who behaves so rudely as family," she snapped,clutching Holley's hand protectively. "Holley is the one I care about! Mark my words-everything in this family belongs to her as well. If you dare try to take it all for yourself, I'll see you kicked out of the Curtis family before you can blink!"

Holley tilted her chin proudly, flashing Marissa a smug grin. With Rita's backing, everything that mattered would eventually belong to her anyway. Marissa was powerless to prevent it.

Just then, a rough voice cut in from nearby. "If Holley wasn't too weak to have children, do you really think the Brooks family would've chosen you, Marissa?"

The words came from Barry Curtis, Holley's older brother.
He continued, "They only agreed to your marriage to Theodore because they needed someone to carry on their bloodline. You should be thanking Holley! If she hadn't insisted they bring you back, you'd still be living who-knows-where!"

Marissa was lost in thought. So that was it? Theodore had married her because Holley couldn't bear children.

And the Curtis family hadn't brought her home out of love or guilt, but because they needed her for the same purpose.

The absurdity almost made Marissa laugh.

In that moment, everything clicked. She finally saw through Rita's real intentions. Her expression stayed composed, almost amused, as if she were watching a group of clowns perform. Then, hearing quick footsteps approaching from behind, she finally broke her silence. "So, if I'munderstanding this correctly...everything I have now isn't because I'm a Curtis, but because Holley was kind enough to grant me her leftovers?"

Holley's lips curled into a condescending smile,but the moment she saw Marc at the doorway, her expression softened instantly. Pulling away from Rita, she fluttered her lashes and said sweetly, "Marissa, you've got it wrong.I didn't mean-"
"Rissa?" Marc's voice cut through the tension as he appeared unexpectedly.

The study upstairs was soundproof-if his assistant hadn't called him about a sudden work matter, he would've never realized Rita, Holley, and Barry had shown up uninvited.

"Marc," Marissa greeted softly, turning just enough to meet his eyes.

"Marc, perfect timing!" Rita exclaimed, relief flashing in her eyes. She'd been struggling to rein Marissa in, and Marc's arrival felt like the perfect chance to tip the scales. She stepped forward, her voice rising as she jabbed a finger in Marissa's direction.

Marissa's eyes flicked toward the staircase. None of her other brothers had come down, nor had Corrine.It was just Marc.

Holley, sensing the tension, decided to play innocent.She stepped away from Rita and hurried toward Marissa,grabbing her arm with exaggerated affection.

"Marissa, don't be upset. Rita's just straightforward;she doesn't mean any harm," she said in a sugary tone that didn't match the malice hiding in her eyes. "You can talk, so why didn't you say something sooner? Or could it be that you just don't want to acknowledge her? Anyway, let's not make things awkward between
family,okay?"
###Chapter 9 I'm Sure You Can Buy Yourself A Miracle


Marissa let out a faint sigh, her lips curling into apolite smile.

With graceful ease, she slipped her arm free from Holley's grasp and gave her a light shove back toward Rita. "I'm afraid I'm not the type who puts up with people so easily."

"Marissa, you!" Holley gasped as she lost her balance,wobbling for a moment before Rita and Barry rushed forward, catching her just before she hit the floor.

"Marissa! You have the audacity to push Holley?!"Rita's shrill voice cracked with rage. Her calm facade vanished as she rolled up her sleeves, ready to lash out.

Marc, on the other hand, actually admired how calmly Marissa handled herself, but seeing Rita and the others ganging up on her made his patience snap. He strode forward and caught Rita's wrist firmly, his voice turning icy. "Rita, if you keep this up, I will take back the winery that was under Uncle's name."

Rita's face froze, her bravado faltering as a flicker of unease crossed her eyes. "I just wanted her to show
some respect. What's wrong with that?"

"Respect? For a mistress who clawed her way to status with a fake pregnancy?" Marissa's tone dripped with venom.

She reached over calmly and gestured for Marc to let go. She had never been one to start a fight, but if someone pushed her, she always made sure they regretted it.

"Utter nonsense!" Rita barked, her face blanching. Of all things, her affair and shameless climb to power were the last topics she wanted brought up.

Marissa's voice turned cool and cutting. "If you've got so much free time to meddle in my life, why not focus on your own? That old man you're keeping company with seems quite taken with another woman lately.And that younger lover of yours? He's been planning to use a few intimate videos to find himself a new girlfriend.Maybe you should spend less time scolding me and more time keeping him... satisfied."

"Enough!" Rita roared, her face flaming red.

Fury twisted her expression as she struggled to hold her composure in front of her family. How could Marissa possibly know all that?

"Rita, isthat true?" Holley's voice trembled as she looked between Rita and Marissa in confusion.
"Don't believe a word she says!" Rita snapped, forcing herself to steady her voice for Holley's sake. Then she turned back to Marissa, her eyes blazing. "Say another word, and I'll teach you a lesson myself!"

Marissa adjusted her cuff with a faint, unbothered smile. "Don't try to test me."

With that, her gaze shifted to Holley, her tone calm but edged with quiet warning. "Holley, you should understand something. Just because you want something doesn't mean everyone else does. So next time,skip the games. I like things straightforward."

She gave Holley's cheek a light pat, which was enough to make the cosmetic fillers under her skin shift slightly.

Barry's stomach twisted. He had a bad feeling that he was next. Swallowing hard, he clasped his hands together and shot Marc a desperate look. "Marc..."

Marc noticed Barry's silent plea out of the corner of his eye but ignored it. His sister clearly had things under control, and he wasn't about to ruin her fun.

"Holley can't have children, but you can help her with that,Barry."

Marissa's words landed like an explosion.

Barry's face went blank with shock, his mouth opening
and closing soundlessly before he finally stammered,"I... I'm a man! This is... this is a mother's role, a woman's work!"

Marissa's cold gaze locked onto him. "You're a Curtis,"she said flatly. "Put your fortune into research. I'm sure you can buy yourself a miracle and figure out how a man can conceive."

Her tone was almost conversational, but the chill beneath it was unmistakable.
###Chapter 10 Hospital Visit


Marissa lifted her hand and casually pointed toward Barry's stomach, her smile bright but sharp enough to make anyone uneasy. "You deeply care for your sister,don't you? Why not go ahead with my suggestion? Find a way to conceive a baby with Theodore, That way,you and your dear sister could even share the same man.Wouldn't that be lovely?"

The image Marissa painted made Barry's stomach churn. He could practically see himself with a swollen belly, and the thought alone made him gag. He stared at her in shock. "You're insane! I'm a man! I don't even have a womb. I can't get pregnant!"

"Oh, relax." Marissa gave him a flat look, as if she were scolding a child for failing a simple question. "You can get anything with money. What's there to be so worked up about? Are you just too scared to try?"

Her expression stayed calm, but her voice carried a quiet cruelty that made her words sting even more.

"You!" Barry's face burned red, his whole body shaking with anger.

"Anyway, I'm tired," Marissa said coolly, brushing him off. "We'll continue this little family chat tomorrow."
"You're not going anywhere!" Rita yelled, her chest rising and falling rapidly. She looked like she might keel over any moment.

But when Marissa glanced her way, she noticed the woman's healthy flush. Rita was fuming, yes, but nowhere near fainting Saying nothing, Marissa turned to go, only to stop short when she met Corrine's tear-filled eyes.

Was she crying again? Honestly, did she have an endless supply of tears? Since they'd reunited, it seemed Corrine hadn't stopped crying once.

Corrine and Andrew had just exited the elevator,stepping into the hallway together.

Her phone screen was glowing in her hand,showing a live video feed. On it, a man was lying on a hospital bed, surrounded by tubes and machines, his face pale and lifeless. The background was filled with the sounds of chaos-raised voices and hurried footsteps

"Dr. Wallace's flight lands after three this afternoon!What's this nonsense about discharging the patient now? Do you think you can disrespect him like that? He canceled an international conference just to come back and operate on this patient! You think money and connections give you the right to ignore medical protocol? Do you even realize how hard it is to schedule surgery with Dr. Wallace?"
A high-pitched female voice crackled through the speaker, echoing in the quiet hallway.

Marissa's brows drew together as she glanced at the group, noticing the sudden heaviness on Corrine's and Andrew's faces.

"Andrew, what's up?" she said, turning toward Corrine but directing the question at him.

No matter how many women she'd met in her life, she had never seen anyone cry this much. Even Evelina,who cried mostly for attention, couldn't keep up with her mother's nonstop sobbing.

"Marissa, your father..." Corrine's voice trembled,her eyes red and puffy as she looked at her daughter.

It felt cruel. She had just found her lost child after so many years, and now she was about to lose her husband.

"Mom!" Marc quickly stepped in before she could say more, turning to his brothers. "Let's get to the hospital right now. I'll call Theodore."

Marissa blinked, watching Marc rush off. Why was he contacting Theodore? Was he looking for Dr. Moore as well?

Marc didn't expect such negligence from his father's doctor. Allowing chaos in his father's ward was beyond
unacceptable. His brows knitted tightly as he made a call while walking out, his tone firm and sharp. "Get everyone out of the ward! If anyone keeps causing trouble, detain them. I'll be there soon!"

Marissa moved closer to Corrine, and her eyes landed on the phone still clutched in her mother's hand. The live feed was still playing. Was that really her father on the screen?

The noise coming from the phone was a mess of shouting and movement.Someone was clearly losing their temper. Then came a loud bang, and everything went quiet.

"Brenden!" Andrew's voice cut through the tense air,nothing like his gentle tone around Marissa. "Get the car ready.Now."

The butler, Brenden Tucker, jumped at the sharp command,replying almost automatically before he fully registered it, "Got it!"

No one spared a glance at Rita, Holley, and Barry as they all hurried out the door.

"Corrine! Are you ignoring me? Did you forget your manners?" Rita gasped dramatically, clutching her chest before collapsing to the floor.

"Rita!" Holley cried out in alarm, running to her
But Rita's theatrics missed their mark this time.Whatever sympathy she had hoped to earn from Corrine didn't work. She was already gone.

The driver sped through the streets, reaching Harmony Hospital in under ten minutes.

"Mom, Rissa, you go in first. I'll wait here for Theodore," Marc said as he stepped out of the car. His voice was calm, hiding his worry, trying to reassure his mother and sister. "Don't worry. Dad's going to be okay."

"Alright," Corrine murmured weakly.

Marissa was standing next to Andrew, when her phone started buzzing in her pocket.

"Marissa, your phone is ringing," Corrine said from her wheelchair, noticing the vibrations. "Go ahead and answer it. It might be the Fletchers calling about something important."

Marissa pulled out her phone, glanced at the caller ID,and looked back at Corrine and Andrew. "I might need a few minutes. You both go ahead and see him first."

Corrine noticed her daughter still couldn't bring herself to say the word "Dad," and it made her heart ache, but still she didn't press. She gently patted Marissa's hand."Should Andrew stay with you?"
Even though they hadn't spent much time together,Corrine could tell her daughter felt more comfortable around Andrew than her other brothers.

"No, it's fine. I'll go in with Marc later," Marissa said,shaking her head lightly.

"Alright." Corrine nodded, With Andrew assisting her in the wheelchair, she quickly made her way inside with the others.

Marissa watched them disappear down the corridor,with her phone still buzzing in her hand.

She then moved to a quiet corner and picked up the call.However, before she could even speak, the voice on the other end hurried out. "Marissa! Thank goodness you picked up! It's urgent. Theodore from the Brooks family is here! He wants to meet you personally. There's a critical surgery coming up, and they're asking for you to perform it. They promised that they won't expose your real identity!"
###Chapter 11 Are You Not Going To Take This Offer


Hearing the excitement in her assistant's voice,Marissa cast a quick< glance toward the hospital entrance. Marc was still standing there, as if waiting for someone. She lowered her gaze, her voice measured and even. "Has the fee increased?"

Dr. Moore was known for charging a high price for anyone actively seeking him out. For particularly tricky cases, he might even waive the surgery fee and just bill for the medicine.

Creating new pharmaceuticals demanded immense financial backing, so Marissa could understand why her assistant sounded so thriled. But she couldn't shake the thought from a few hours earlier, when she had met Theodore. He didn't know her real identity then,and now he was promising not to reveal it. That claim made her pause, curious and cautious about what it really meant.

The assistant, Garry Cullen, could barely contain his excitement "Yes, Marissa! The fee has gone up five times over! The Brooks family is extremely generous.Should we accept it? Benny said that if you agree, we can send your things over immediately."
Garry and his brother Benny Cullen, both her assistants, were individuals she trusted completely.Since she spent so much time at the Fletchers' house,she kept a portion of her belongings at their small clinic for safety.

Garry,noticing her long silence, spoke up with a hint of admiration in his voice. "Marissa, the Brooks family went out of their way to track us down, even with all the security Benny has in place. Honestly, he deserves a cut of the blamne for that." He then asked bluntly, "Are you not going to take this offer?"

It was unusual for her to stay silent for so long.

"Fine, I'll refuse it then," Garry continued, ready to end the call. "Don't worry. They won't find out your real identity!"

Benny and Garry had worked for Marissa for quite some time. She knew she could trust them completely.After all, they owed their lives to her.

"No need," Marissa replied, her curiosity piqued by Theodore, the man meant to be her husband.

Garry let out a relieved breath. "Okay then," he said,wiping a bead of sweat from his forehead. He had bet with the team that she would accept the deal.

Marissa's lips parted slightly as a thought came to her."Stick to the original fee."
Garry, switching to a backup phone, quickly stopped the previous email and asked in surprise, "What? Why?We could really use the extra money"

Marissa simply pinched the bridge of her nose and did not utter a single word.

Garry's patience began to wear thin as he tried to reason with her. "Marissa, please explain. Why are you insisting on the original fee? They're the Brooks family;money isn't an issue for them. And besides, the rare herb you're looking for is appearing on the black market. Whoever bids highest will get it. The more funds we have, the better we'll be prepared. Marissa,what are you thinking? Please, tell me."

"Alright," Marissa responded lightly. "Let's go with your suggestion."

"Fivetimes the usual fee?" Garry asked to confirm

"Yes," she answered succinctly.

Garry continued, "Oh, and by the way, another batch of your fiancé's medication has been developed. Do you want to pick it up, or should I have it delivered? Dr.Stewart says this new batch is far more effective than the last, thanks to your earlier advice. Unlike Dr.Wallace, who insisted on his own methods and wasted a bunch of valuable herbs, this time it's spot on. I even noticed the price of those herbs had gone up because
of our frequent purchases. These merchants are really cunning! So... should I bring medication to you?"

"That won't be necessary," Marissa replied, her expression turning sharp as the memory of Bryson's antics at the banquet crossed her mind. "Keep this batch off the market for now. Just store it safely. If Dr.Stewart has any questions, he can ask me directly."

"And if Dr. Wallace asks?"

"Ignore him," she replied firmly.

"Copy that." Garry nodded.

Meanwhile, at the hospital entrance, Marc met up with Theodore. The two had discussed things earlier, and Theodore understood Marc's intentions.

"Dr. Moore has replied. The surgery is set for tonight.He'll visit this afternoon to assess your father's condition and prepare what's needed1" Theodore assured him.

Marc gave a small nod, looking relieved.

Marissa,without any direct contact info for the Curtis family, waited in the hospital lobby after hanging up.She noticed Marc and Theodore heading toward the VIP elevator and called out,"Marc."

Theodore glanced back at her even before Marc did.
"Miss Curtis," he said, his intense gaze fixed on her delicate features, as though trying to read her thoughts

"Mr. Brooks," she greeted, moving toward them. Before Marc could question her, she quickly clarified why she was still there

"Sorry, Rissa. We actually had a banquet planned tonight to welcome you back, but unfortunately, we've had to cancel it." Marc sighed
###Chapter 12 This Is Your Father


Marc's eyes were heavy with guilt.

Dr. Moore showing up in Ozreka so suddenly had completely thrown off their plans.

"It's alright," Marissa said calmly, showing no sign of frustration.

Her understanding only made Marc feel worse, but with Theodore present, he coudn't explain the entire situation to her.

Inwardly, he resolved that the banquet absolutely could not be canceled.

Inside the VIP ward of Harmony Hospital, their father,Rayden Curtis, lay unconscious on the bed. His eyes were closed, his face pale, and his cheeks hollowed.

The Curtis and Brooks families had successfully kept the Curtis couple's car accident a secret, ensuring no news reached the outside world.

When Marissa and Marc, with Theodore at their side,opened the hospital room door, only Corrine and Danny were present. Andrew and the others were nowhere in siqht.
Corrine rested her face gently against Rayden's fragile hand.Hearing them enter, she lifted her head, brushed away tears, and called softly to Marissa, "Come here,Marissa."

Marissa's gaze lingered on Rayden's face. While her brothers had clearly inherited Corrine's elegance,Marissa bore a perfect resemblance to Rayden,carrying the same refined, understated beauty.

She quietly stepped closer to Corrine. Perhaps it was the bond of blood; looking down at Rayden's pale,lifeless face, she felt a slow, hollow ache stir in her heart.

The treatment she had refused last time... had been for her own father.

Half a month ago, Marissa had still been researching Bryson's medication. When Garry called to ask her to treat a patient, she dismissed him outright.

"Marissa," Corrine murmured, holding her daughter's hand. "This...this is your father."

Marissa opened her mouth, but no words came. She turned her face away, noting the absence of Danny and Marc, who should have been in the room, while Theodore remained present.

"Don't be upset with your father, Marissa.If he weren't in a coma, he would have been there to bring you home
himself." Corrine's mind was scattered, and though her words tumbled out continuously, she barely noticed.

"I know. You're tired. Rest now," Marissa said, noticing her mother's restless state.

She carefully helped Corrine onto the companion bed and,with a discreet motion hidden beneath her suit jacket, applied pressure to a point on the back of her neck. Immediately, Corrine stopped murmuring and slipped into a deep,peaceful sleep.

Theodore,not watching closely, didn't notice a thing.

Just then, a polite knock came at the door.

Theodore, being the closest, took two long strides and opened it.

Standing outside was a young doctor in a crisp white coat, accompanied by a nurse.

"Are you part of Mr. Curtis's family?" the doctor asked,looking at Theodore.

"They're inside," Theodore replied calmly, gesturing for the doctor and nurse to enter.

With Marissa present, he made no move to overstep or interfere.

Marissa, watching Theodore closely, raised an eyebrow. Seeing him leave the conversation with the
doctor to her made her roll her eyes.

After all, she had just returned to the Curtis family today; how could she have known about Rayden's condition?

The young doctor snapped the medical record shut,his face tense, eyes flashing with barely contained anger. "As a doctor, I can't comprehend your thinking.Mr. Curtis is in critical condition, and transferring him now could be life-threatening! In Ozreka, which hospital has better equipment than Harmony? If this hospital wasn't good enough, then why was it your family's choice in the first place? Dr. Wallace is arriving this afternoon to perform the surgery himself. His skills are legendary, and there has never been a single post-op complication under his care, We aren't forcing anyone to stay here, but as medical professionals, we must act responsibly. Considering Mr. Curtis's current condition, he needs a surgeon of Dr. Wallace's caliber.When he arrived, he was at death's door, and it was only because of Dr. Wallace's timely intervention that he survived..."

"Could you please quiet down?" Marissa interrupted smoothly, her eyes fixed on the young doctor's refined features. "I can tell you're a fan of Dr. Wallace. We don't need to hear aboutit."

The young doctor froze, caught off guard by her words. His argument died on his lips as he tried to
respond

"Are your checks complete?" Marissa asked, her gaze steady and probing as she noticed him lingering.

The young doctor nodded almost automatically and left the room with the nurse. Pausing at the door, his mind buzzed with questions. He wondered why he had left so obediently.

"Dr.Mitchell?" the nurse prompted gently.

Hayes Mitchell suddenly asked, "How did I do just now? If Dr. Wallace finds out, will it make an impression on him?"

The nurse shot him an awkward look and said nothing Meanwhile, inside the room, Marissa's phone rang again,

Theodore looked at her, his eyes tracing the soft curls by her ear. "Go ahead, answer it. I'll take care of things here,"he said.

"Thank you," Marissa replied smoothly, stepping out to pick up the call.

As the door began to close, Theodore caught the shift in her voice, and it sounded different from before.

"Miss me, honey?" he heard her say, and his eyes narrowed.

###Chapter 13 She's Your Daughter


Theodore was surprised when Marissa called the person on the phone "honey."

Could it be her boyfriend?

A shadow passed over Theodore's face as his cold gaze fell on the partially open hospital door. The black phone twirled between his fingers, and then a low chuckle escaped him.

His fiancée appeared to be full of hidden little secrets.

Containing his grin, he swiftly typed out a message.

Marissa didn't bother hiding to take the call. She hadn't gone far, merely leaning against the ward door.

"I'll go with you at the end of the month," she replied concisely. A playful whine reached her from the other line, prompting her to smirk slightly. "Keep acting like that, and you might see your allowNance cut..."

Before she could finish, a booming male voice cut through the corridor, harsh and commanding

"Move! Don't block the way!"

Harmony Hospital's hallways were spacious, and with her slim frame, there was no way she was in anyone's
way.

Wanting to avoid unnecessary trouble, Marissa stepped aside.

The man was huge, his broad shoulders seemed to fill the hallway, and he held his swollen belly with his left hand, clearly eager to get to the restroom.

"No loud noises in the hospital!" a nurse called out sternly, frowning at him.

"Get lost!" he barked, shoving her aside without a second thought.

Marissa's eyes caught the bulge at his waist It looked like a gun.

Her attention was then arrested by a sudden detail.The man's chest hair didn't match the color of his head hair. Something clicked, and her calm demeanor snapped into focus. Slipping her phone into her suit pocket, she confronted the man, her voice icy. "Stop right there!"

"Get lost!" he snapped, trying to shake her off, but she held firm. "You bitch! Looking for trouble?" he growled,showing his yellowed teeth.

Marissa's eyes narrowed. "What a fool," she thought.

"You're the one causing trouble."
Her words cut likesteel as she drove her elbow into a pressure point beneath his arm with pinpoint accuracy.

Instantly, his arm went numb, his left hand dropping uselessly. The swollen belly he had been holding suddenly deflated, and a tiny, beautiful little girl toppled out.

Marissa caught her without missing a beat.

The little girl and Marissa stared at each other, wide-eyed.

"You insane woman! Give her back!" the man shouted.

A cold, hard object pressed against Marissa's temple as she cradled the girl and looked up calmly

"Go ahead.Shoot."

Her face was a mask of calm, her eyes sharp and serious as she provoked him.

His hand shook violently. "Don't think I won't!"

"Can't bring yourself to do it? Let me demonstrate."

The sound of a gunshot ripped through the hallway's silence.

"Ah." A nurse let out a small scream, hastily covering her mouth in shock.

She hadn't seen it clearly, but the massive man went
crashing to the floor.

Holding the child in one arm, Marissa twirled the black gun between her fingers. "You really think that toy can scare me?"

The man writhed in pain, staring at her in terror. "Give me back my daughter!"

Marissa glanced down at the little girl in her arms, then back at him, shaking her head. "With a face like that,you think you could ever have such a beautiful child?"

"I'm calling the police!" he shouted, glancing around nervously.

"Want me to call them for you?" Marissa asked calmly,her face blank and unmoved by his threat

The man struggled to get up, but Marissa held the child securely, covering her eyes with one hand, and pressed him back down with a firm stomp.

"How could she be this strong?" he thought, pinned and powerless beneath her.

Marissa bent down slightly, her cool gaze meeting his shocked eyes. "You better explain everything to the police," she warned.

Funny! He had been so eager to call them himself.

And she intended to make sure he did.
The man was still reeling from the precise strike she'd landed earlier. Sweat drenched his pale face as he stared at her, with horror written across his features."Did... did you call the police?"

His voice trembled with fear.

"Yes," Marissa said calmly, tugging slightly at the corner of her lips. "No need to thank me."

Swearing under his breath, he tried to push himself upright but failed.

From the elevator, Wilbur stared at the scene in utter disbelief. He tilted his head, thinking for a moment before picking up his phone.

"Mr. Brooks..." he began, unsure how to describe it. It would be better if Theodore saw it for himself.

Wasn't Marissa supposed to be useless and weak?

But after witnessing what had happened, Wilbur realized the rumors had clearly been wrong.

With a loud click, the hospital room door swung shut.

Marissa's attention shifted to the sound, and there he was.. Theodore, standing at the doorway, calmly watching her.

She carefully set the little girl down and straightened up, wondering when he had arrived and how much he
had seen.
Did he witness her fight?

The man saw an opening and lunged for the girl, trying to escape,but Marissa reacted instantly and kicked his wrist. He howled in pain, writhing on the floor.

"Planning to run now, huh?" she asked casually.

Theodore remained motionless, silently taking in the scene.

After the brawl in the warm corridor, Marissa's makeup was now smudged.

Their gazes met, with the sounds of the defeated man moaning faintly behind them.

"Mommy!" The girl pressed herself against Marissa,hugging her leg tightly for comfort.

Marissa froze for a moment, caught off guard.

"She's your daughter?" Theodore frowned.

A shadow flickered across his intense eyes, his lips tightening into a firm line, giving off a cold, intimidating presence
###Chapter 14 Are You Impotent


Marissa was momentarily stunned, then displayed a look of confusion.

Theodore leaned against the doorway, one hand in his pocket, his face calm and unreadable as he waited for her to speak.

Marissa's eyes moved from him to the little girl holding tightly onto her leg.

"My daughter?" she repeated. Her calm tone sounded less like a question and more like a quiet confirmation.

The man on the floor wouldn't stop yelling, his voice grating on her nerves.

Marissa's patience snapped, and she kicked him again,harder this time.

Theodore's face betrayed no surprise He watched calmly as Marissa kicked the man so forcefully he couldn't even roll over.

Marissa had planned to knock the idiot out cold with a solid kick.

But whether it was his stubbornness or her restraint to keep things from getting messy, the man only howled
in pain instead of blacking out

She hesitated, wondering if she should give him another one just to finish the job.

Before she could decide, the little girl toddled over and, trying to copy Marissa, lifted her tiny foot to kick the man too.

Her balance wobbled, and as she raised her short leg,she started tipping backward.

Marissa didn't move until the very last moment. When the girl was about to fall, she casually reached out,grabbed her by the back of her collar, and hauled her upright.

"Don't cause trouble," she said flatly.

"Mommy?" The girl wriggled as the collar held her in place. Seeing Theodore, her almond-shaped eyes widened."Daddy!"

Her call of "Daddy" came out louder and clearer than her earlier "Mommy."

She stretched her chubby arms toward Theodore,trying to reach him.

Marissa blinked once, then tilted her head toward Theodore.

"Your daughter?" she asked, carrying the girl as she
walked closer to him. "Here"

Her tone was calm, but a faint chill lingered in her eyes.

Whether he accepted the girl or not didn't matter to her. Once the child was within reach, Marissa released her hold and stepped back, making it clear she wanted no part in the matter.

But Theodore unexpectedly stepped away, and the little girl dropped toward the floor with a startled cry.

A nurse gasped and turned her head away; she couldn't bear to watch what happened next.

"Daddy?" the girl called again.

Standing between Theodore and Marissa, she looked at him, who ignored her entirely.

Then she turned to Marissa, who remained just as indifferent.

Her small face scrunched in frustration, her eyes darting between them like she couldn't decide who to be angry at first.

"The man is a human trafficker?" Theodore finally broke the silence, his eyes scanning the prone man.

"I'm not sure," Marissa replied calmly, taking out her phone. She noticed the earlier call had already ended but didn't bother to call back. Instead, she quickly
drafted a message to report the incident to the police.

The man was stunned.

Marissa hadn't even confirmed if he was a human trafficker, yet he had already been beaten.

"I'm not a human trafficker!" he shouted, panic flashing in his eyes as he stared at Marissa. "She's my daughter!"

His tone was desperate, but no one responded,

Theodore studied the man impassively for a moment before turning to Marissa. "Did you contact the police?" he asked.

The man's jaw dropped. They were talking about calling the police right in front of him, like he wasn't even there.

"I said I'm not a human trafficker! That's my daughter!"he yelled again, but it was as if his words fell into a void.

No one acknowledged him.

"Yes," Marissa replied, giving her phone a small shake.

Theodore glanced over at Wilbur, who immediately caught on.

He made a call right away.
Within moments, a few burly men in black suits emerged, moved swiftly toward the thug, and covered his mouth before dragging him away.

Marissa rubbed her wrist and watched quietly as the man was dragged off. Those bodyguards looked capable and probably packed quite a punch,too

She wouldn't mind having a few of them under her command.

Pulling herself from the thought, she decided there was no point in wasting another second on that man.Once he was out of sight, she turned to head back toward the ward with Theodore.

Wilbur, meanwhile, had crouched down, intending to hand the little girl to the nearby nurse

But the nurse shook her head quickly, stepping back in alarm. "She's not mine!" she blurted.

"Put out an announcement," Wilbur suggested. "Her parents are probably still somewhere in the hospital."

Judging by the girl's neat outfit and accessories,she clearly belonged to a well-off family.

The nurse hesitated, clearly terrified of getting involved. "You should come with me instead!"

"Wilbur,"
Wilbur turned at the sound of his name and saw Andrew walking toward him.

"Mr. Curtis," Wilbur greeted him respectfully.

"This child..." Andrew leaned closer, studying the girl's face.It looked strangely familiar.

"Your sister saved her from a suspected human trafficker," Wilbur explained briefly.

Before Andrew could respond, the little girl suddenly squirmed in Wilbur's arms, reaching eagerly toward Theodore.

Wilbur reacted fast, instinctively tightening his hold before she could slip away, but the girl pouted, pushing against him with surprising strength for her size.

Marissa chuckled softly and gave the girl's chubby cheek a playful pinch.

The child's lips trembled instantly, tears welling up as if she were about to burst into a loud cry.

"Miss Curtis!" Wilbur's patience was wearing thin He gave her a helpless look before shifting his gaze toward Theodore for help.

"I wasn't rough," Marissa said coolly "Maybe you should hand her to the police. Or is she Theodore's secret daughter?"
Her voice carried a teasing edge. In dramas and novels, men like Theodore' always seemed to have some hidden child appear out of nowhere.

"That's a terrible misunderstanding," Wilbur blurted,quickly setting the little girl down on the sofa. "Mr.Brooks has never had any relationships."

"Oh." Maríssa's reply was flat, her interest fading as fast as it came.

Her eyes roamed over Theodore, studying every detail,but she found nothing that hinted at a flaw So why hadn't he ever been with a woman?

Then she looked him squarely in the eye and asked without hesitation, "Are you impotent?"

A ghost of a smirk touched Theodore's lips."Would you like to find out yourself?"

His calmness only made him more intimidating. The sharp lines of his features gave off a cold, powerful presence that made it hard for anyone to look him in the eye.

He slowly moved to stand up, his every action carrying quiet strength.
###Chapter 15 Maxton Wallace


Wilbur was quietly horrified. Marissa truly had no filter.She could say the boldest things without flinching.

Even Andrew, observing from the side, thought Theodore's intimidating posture looked a little too intentional, almost like he was putting on a show.

His gaze flicked toward his sister, his usual brightness dimming into mild confusion.

Marissa, however, looked entirely unbothered. Her calm eyes swept past Theodore as if his intimidating aura didn't even register.

She leaned forward slightly and gave his knee a light tap, neither teasing nor timid, and asked in her composed tone, "Mr. Brooks, why the rush?"

Her cool gaze met his head-on. "If my assessment is correct, you shouldn't be doing anything too strenuous," she added matter-of-factly.

The tension in the room hung thick until Andrew suddenly broke into laughter, unable to holdit in.

Both Marissa and Theodore turned their eyes on him at once
"Don't mind me," Andrew said quickly, grinning as he focused on his phone instead. "Just pretend I'm invisible."

His fingers danced over the screen, still trembling slightly with suppressed laughter.

Thereafter, the earlier intensity vanished completely

When the police arrived to take the little girl, she burst into tears, crying out for Marissa and Theodore.

With her big eyes and soft curls, she actually did look like she could be their daughter.

The child sobbed miserably, but Marissa only gave a casual wave and said cheerfully, "Goodbye!"

A woman walking by stopped to glare at them,her voice filled with righteous indignation. "Can't you see she doesn't want to leave? Why are you making her cry like that?"

What the hell? Who even was this lady? And why was she suddenly interfering?

Raising an eyebrow, Marissa gave her a chilly once-over

"And what's it to you?" she replied flatly before walking away without another glance.

"You!" the woman sputtered, left fuming in place
Later, as the time for her appointment approached,Marissa found a convenient excuse to slip away.

In the quiet stairwell, Garry and Lillian Marsh were already waiting.

Garry was dressed casually in a plain T-shirt and pants.

Lillian, on the other hand, looked like she'd stepped out of a street fashion magazine-heavy makeup, piercings glinting on her brows and lips, and a rebellious air that screamed trouble.

Marissa frowned the moment she saw her. "Are you planning to walk into the operating room dressed like that?" Her tone was sharp but not harsh. "Take everything off."

Lillian let out a nervous laugh, scratching her cheek "Got it! I'll change right now."

She didn't dare mention she'd come straight from another errand with no time to switch outfits.

Grabbing a large black bag, she hurried toward the restroom.

Meanwhile, Garry handed Marissa a small,inconspicuous case and said in a low voice, "Here's what you asked for"
Moments later, Marissa emerged looking entirely different. Her long hair was gone,replaced by a clean,short cut, and a pair of simple glasses now framed her face. Dressed in a simple outfit, she looked all set and ready.

The fifth floor had already been cleared for privacy,and the three of them quickly made their way toward the operating room.

Once inside, Garry immediately began scanning the area with his equipment.

After checking every corner, he reported, "No surveillance cameras found."

"Good," Marissa replied curtly.

She wasn't one for unnecessary words, especially before surgery. Without hesitation, she changed into sterile clothing.

Meanwhile, outside the hospital, a sleek luxury car came to a stop, and a tall, refined-looking man stepped out-Maxton Wallace.

"Is everything ready?" he asked, removing his watch and handing it to his assistant before rubbing his temples tiredly. "Are those orthopedic doctors completely useless?"

"Dr. Wallace, please don't be angry," the assistant
quickly said with a nervous smile. "They just believe you are more capable of handling such a risky surgery than they are. That's all."

Maxton exhaled, calming slightly. Tossing his coat to the assistant, he said firmly, "Let's go. After this surgery, I want to meet Dr. Moore in person. I've heard enough about him, so it's time I see what this mysterious genius looks like."

He had flown back the moment he heard that Dr.Moore had shown up in Ozreka.

As soon as Maxton stepped out of the elevator,he stopped at the sight of several bodyguards near the operating room door. "Hold on a moment," he said casually. "I just need to use the restroom first."

One of the bodyguards immediately stepped forward

"Sir, you'll need to use a restroom on another floor," he said firmly, blocking Maxton's path.

Maxton's face darkened instantly.

"What's that supposed to mean?" His assistant snapped. "Dr. Wallace came all this way to operate on your boss, and this is how you treat him?"

The security team leader blinked in surprise.

Ten minutes ago, he'd been informed that Dr. Moore was already inside performing the surgery. So...who
was this man claiming to be the surgeon?

Uncertain, he quickly radioed Marc. "Mr. Curtis, there's a man here claiming he's the surgeon invited to operate on your father."

Marc frowned deeply upon hearing that.

"I'll come check myself," he said before heading toward the elevator.

Through the intercom, everyone outsidethe operating room could hear bits of the exchange.

"Sir, may I ask your name?" the team leader inquired respectfully.

"This is Dr. Maxton Wallace," the assistant answered quickly, puffing up his chest. "Surely you've heard of him?"

"I'm sorry, Dr. Wallace," the guard said evenly. "Please wait a moment while I confirm."

"Terrance," Maxton said sharply, his voice cold as he shot his assistant a warning look, "Lower your voice.This is a hospital."

Terrance Kirby fell silent, though his glare said enough."Still, this is ridiculous,sir."

Maxton had never been stopped like this before,especially not outside an operating room.
Just then, a familiar voice called out, "Dr. Wallace?"

Maxton turned and saw Christy Griffin, a former student of his grandfather.

Marc arrived a second later

"Dr. Griffin," Maxton acknowledged Christy, then faced
Marc. "You must be the patient's family?"

Marc nodded and was about to respoond when Christy removed her mask. Her face, carefully made up, was framed by loose strands of hair that she tucked behind her ear.

"You're finally here," she said, half-smiling. "Mr. Curtis has been waiting for you."
###Chapter 16 We Scored Big This Time


Christy had no idea that the entire fifth floor had been cleared specifically for Dr. Moore. She assumed it was the Curtis family's way of honoring Maxton After all,he'd flown back from abroad just to assist with the surgery

Maxton, however, wasn't convinced. He wasn't a stranger to the Curtises, and something about this setup didn't quite add up. He hadn't heard anything about a member of the Curtis family being seriously ill,so what was going on?

"Mr. Curtis, did you happen to bring in another doctor?" Maxton asked directly, his tone calm but probing. As he rolled up his sleeves, his forearms flexed with effortless strength.

"Yes," Marc replied smoothly, extending a polite hand with his usual composed smile. "Marc Curtis. A pleasure to meet you."

"Maxton Wallace," Maxton introduced himself, shaking Marc's hand briefly.

"My apologies, Dr. Wallace," Marc said with a polite,regretful smile. "It seems we've made you come all this way for nothing."
Maxton gave a polite smile, instantly understanding the situation. Clearly, the Curtis family had found another specialist, someone they believed to be more capable.

"No problem, Mr Curtis," he said evenly, his professionalism intact. "If I may ask, which doctor did you hire?"

Marc's reply was calm and simple. "Dr.Moore."

The name made Maxton pause fo a moment.

The Curtis family, one of the country's top financial dynasties, occasionally worked with the Wallaces.

Maxton had no reason to take offense over something like this.

Still, hearing that name stirred something in him.

So Dr. Moore was really here. He'd sent countless emails trying to reach that elusive surgeon, all without a single reply. And now, out of sheer coincidence,they were in the same building,

"Would it be possible for me to observe Dr Moore's surgical procedure?" Maxton asked, his tone casual but his eyes sharp with interest.

Before Marc could respond, Christy piped up excitedly,stepping forward between them. "Oh! I'd like to watch too! I've always wanted to see Dr Moore in action!"She raised her hand like an eager student, beaming
brightly

"Dr. Griffin, that's enough," Terrance said quickly,pulling her back.

Marc's polite smile didn't falter as he replied, "I'm afraid that won't be possible, Dr. Wallace."

For a brief moment, disappointment flickered across Maxton's face, though he masked it with an easy smile."I understand," he said lightly. "Then I'll stay out of the way and return once the surgery's complete."

He knew Dr. Moore's habits-perform the operation,then leave the post-op care to others.

There would be time later to approach him properly

"Thank you for your understanding, Dr. Wallace," Marc said, walking Maxton toward the elevator with courteous respect.

Inside the operating room, Marissa remained oblivious to everything happening outside.

She was busy finishing the final steps of the procedure.

Initially, she'd planned to let Lillian handle the wrap-up but then decided to do it herself instead.

When she finally removed her gloves, Lillian glanced at the clock.
"Twenty-eight minutes flat," she murmured in quiet amazement.

"Marissa, what's next for you?" she asked as they began cleaning up. "Are you planning to apply to a university?"

Marissa paused, tossng her gloves into the bin."Haven't decided yet."

Meanwhile, Garry was already disinfecting and packing the tools he'd brought, double-checking every corner of the room for possible surveillance devices before they left.

Once he was sure everything was clear, he hesitated for a moment and asked, "Want to check out the lab?"

Marissa turned to glance at the unconscious Rayden on the table. After a short pause, she shook her head."Not today. I have something else to take care of."

Garry frowned. "Marissa, are you seriously still worried about Bryson? He cheated on you! Why even bother?"

"It's not about him," she replied calmly. "It's something else."

She had been about to mention her connection to the Curtis family but decided against it. This was not the setting for such revelations.

"Really?" Garry pressed, clearly doubtful.
"Yes"

Her composure left him no room to argue. Seeing that calm look on her face, he could only sigh and hope she truly meant it.

A faint smile tugged at Marissa's lips as a thought crossed her mind-Bryson and Evelina.

Lillian noticed immediately. "Marissa, what's got you smiling like that?" she asked curiously.

Before Marissa could answer, GGarry chuckled "Isn't it obvious? We scored big this time! Right, Marissa?"

Marissa gave a small nod, offering no further explanation.

She obviously couldn't admit she was secretly amused,knowing Evelina would soon discover Bryson's impotence once they were intimate.

Garry checked the account. "The Brooks family sure doesn't waste time. The payment came in early, like they weren't even worried we'd take the money and disappear. They really are something."

"I want to travel to Waemery," Lillian said, propping her chin in her hands with a smile.

"In your dreams!" Garry teased immediately.

Meanwhile, Marissa was focused on writing post-op
care instructions on a sheet of paper. She double-checked every line, making sure she hadn't missed a single detail.

"Marissa, honestly," Garry said softly, his tone more genuine now, "that guy was bad luck. Ever since you left him, you've been smiling more, even being gentler with patients."

Before,Marissa would have walked out the moment the operation ended-no follow-ups, no instructions,nothing.

"Let's not talk about him," she replied evenly, clipping the note to the IV stand. Then she turned to them "Let's go."

"Marissa, how about dinner tonight? I'll cook" Garry fell into step beside her, trying to sound casual, though his heart raced nervously, fearing rejection.

She reached for the door, but he quickly opened it for her,gesturing for her to go first.

Wiping her hands with a wet tissue, she said lightly, "I already have plans tonight."

She'd just returned to the Curtis family and couldn't afford to reveal too much too soon. The last thing she wanted was for her identity as Dr. Moore to come out before she was ready to face the consequences
"Oh." Garry's voice dropped, his expression briefly clouded with disappointment. But he quickly recovered, forcing a grin as he slung his bag over his shoulder. "Alright then. I'll see you tomorrow at the lab."

"Make sure Benny keeps an eye on any black market activity," Marissa reminded him as she walked off.

"Got it! I'll handle it."

He waved and disappeared around the corner. Just as the hallway grew quiet again, Marissa suddenly heard a familiar voice.

"Marc, the doctor said Rita's condition can't wait any longer. Could you please ask the nurse to check if Dr.
Moore is done with your father's surgery? Please,I'm begging you."

Marissa froze, Was that Holley?
###Chapter 17 You've Been Different


Barely an hour ago, Rita had been perfectly fine. Yet within less than seventy minutes, her condition had taken a turn for the worse?

Marissa glanced down at the white coat she hadn't even had time to change, paused for a moment, and then headed toward the commotion.

As she turned the corner, she passed Lillian, who was dressed in a nurse's uniform. Neither woman so much as exchanged a glance; they moved past each other like complete strangers. Marissa caught a few words of Lillian's soft voice as she spoke to Danny. "I was just called in to help. I didn't pay special attention to the surgeon. All the doctors here wear white coats,and...well, I'm a litte face-blind,so..."

Lillian had that kind of face that made people drop their guard-round eyes, soft features, and a sweet innocence that drew trust effortlessly.

She was quick-witted too, one of the reasons Marissa had always kept her close.

But today, she was up against Danny, someone who had studied psychology and could see through pretenses faster than most. Even as Lillian spoke, his
gaze flicked past her, lingering suspiciously on Marissa.

From the outside, Marissa's white coat looked just like the ones worn by Harmony Hospital staff, except hers didn't have the hospital emblem on the pocket. Still,there was something about her that felt oddly familiar,though he couldn't figure out why.

Catching his stare, Lillian chuckled softly, her hand half-covering her smile and her eyes gleaming with amusement. "You know, it's rude to stare at a woman for that long."

Rita's hospital room was next to Rayden's, and the door stood wide open.

Inside, Holley was practically draped over Marc,sobbing so dramatically that the scene bordered on theatrical.Marc had tried multiple times to push her away, but she wouldn't budge.

"Rita already took her medicine, and Dr. Wallace just checked on her. It's nothing serious," Marc said, his patience fraying. "She only needs to rest before she can go home. Dr. Moore is still performing surgery on my father, and yet you insist on calling Dr. Moore to see her too. Holley, don't you think you're going too far?"

With one firm motion, he managed to pry her off.

Holley trembled, forcing down her fear as she sobbed
harder. "How can you say that, Marc? Am I really that unreasonable? I'm just worried about Rita!" Her voice quivered, but her eyes darted up to study his reaction."Dr. Wallace said Dr. Moore's surgeries never take more than thirty minutes. It's been almost forty, and surely the surgery's done by now! Ever since Marissa came back, you've been different. You're colder.You never used to talk to me this way!"

Her tears, which had started as an act, soon became real. She truly felt the distance between them now.There was a time when she had been the darling of the Curtis household. Everything she wanted was given to her without hesitation. But now, even her smallest requests were met with cold indifference.

And all of it, she believed, was because of Marissa.

Holley's mind seethed as she wiped her tears. Marissa had been living comfortably with the Fletchers, so why had she suddenly decided to come back? It was infuriating.

"Holley, stop twisting things around," Marc said,stepping back as if putting physical distance could draw a clearer line. "You're my cousin. Rissa is my real sister. Do you understand that difference?"

He didn't mince words. There was a big gap between a cousin and a sister, and Marc made sure she knew it.He wasn't about to let Holley's wild thoughts take root,
not when it came to Marissa. It was a fine line he had to walk.

Whatever concern he'd shown Holley before was only out of respect for family ties, nothing more. That connection was pale compared to the loyalty he felt toward his own siblings.

"Barry will be here soon," he added firmly. "Don't stir up trouble in the hospital. Just stay put."

Without another glance, Marc turned and walked away from Rita's ward.

"Excuse me! We're making rounds!" someone called out.

Marissa had wanted to slip away unnoticed, but the sudden rush of people in the corridor forced her back against the wall. A young nurse trailing behind Christy caught sight of Marissa's white coat and asked with mild curiosity, "Are you new here? I don't think l've seen you before."

Marissa didn't bother replying. She rubbed her elbow lightly and cast a brief look at Christy, making sure to remember her face.

Maxton was still around the hospital, and Christy was clearly trying to get noticed. She wasn't even wearing a mask, eager to show her face at every opportunity. The visit to Rita's ward, which had originally been assigned
to a trainee, was now her chosen chance to shine.

"Less talking, more moving!" Christy barked, her tone sharp and self-important. "We still need to review the case with Dr. Wallace after this."

The young nurse flinched at her words and immediately looked away, hurrying after her.

Watching the exchange, Marc didn't stick around either and made his way straight toward the operating room.

As soon as he disappeared, Holley's act fell apart.She pulled out a small mirror and began fixing her makeup like nothing had happened.

"How's Mrs. Curtis doing now?" Christy inquired.

Holley, not even looking up, replied impatiently, "Didn't Dr. Wallace already diagnose her? Why are you asking again? Shouldn't you already know what to do? She's still unconscious; how am I supposed to answer for her?"

Holley had met Maxton through his sister, Karlee Wallace,who would often marvel that her once good-for-nothing brother was now a doctor.

Christy's face darkened. "Watch your tone."
###Chapter 18 I've Got A Method That Could Help


Christy snapped the medical record book shut, her carefully applied makeup unable to hide her growing irritation.

Towering over the petite Holley, she radiated an air of authority, her posture stiff with confrontation.

Holley, unruffled, casually dabbed at her lipstick, her confidence unshaken. As a Curtis, she was used to being the center of attention, her defiant streak a product of constant adoration.

To her, Christy's probing felt like an annoying hum,barely worth acknowledging.

Christy, hailing from a well-off family, could muster a facade of warmth around Maxton but had no patience for coddling a patient's family.

"Dr. Wallace treated Mrs. Curtis, yet you questioned his competence, didn't you? Now, as the attending physician, I'm entitled to know her condition. If you're clueless, find another family member who isn't,"Christy snapped, her tone sharp with thinly veiled accusations of neglect.
"You're really annoying," Holley shot back, brushing off Christy's lecture. Glancing at Marissa, who lingered in the doorway watching the scene unfold, she waved her in. "Hey, you're a doctor, right? Come in and check on my family. I want to know if this hospital has any trustworthy doctors!"

Marissa, her expression cool and detached, gave the room a lazy once-over. "From what I can see, your family's fine-she is just worked up emotionally. If you want her awake sooner, I've got a method that could help."

Marissa had zero interest in the odd feud brewing between Holley and Christy.

Her detached tone and lack of enthusiasm made her seem even more distant than Maxton.

Christy frowned. Even the most esteemed doctors meticulously assessed patients before treatment.Was this doctor merely an intern wandering through the hospital without purpose?

She made a mental note to address the growing carelessness of the interns at the Friday meeting.

"No thorough workup, but you have a treatment?Who's your supervising physician? The fifth floor isn't
a place for casual strolls, no matter your reasons,"Christy snapped, her eyes narrowing with distrust as
she scrutinized Marissa, her voice growing sharper."Are you here for Dr. Wallace?"

Christy's possessiveness surged-though her relationship with Maxton remained stagnant, she already claimed him in her mind, determined to keep other women at bay.

Marissa roll her eyes. Stepping forward, she raised an eyebrow at Holley. "Should I proceed?"

Holley, fully aware of the incident that landed Rita in the hospital, was curious about this doctor's expertise.She wanted to make another trip to Corrine's place but felt uneasy going without Rita accompanying her.

The thought of Marissa, who had effortlessly stolen her spotlight, sent a sharp pang of resentment through Holley. A glint of malice flickered in her eyes before she masked it with a tight smile and gave a brisk nod. "Go ahead. I hope you won't let me down," she said coldly.

Marissa couldn't quite decipher Holley's motives, but treating Rita was a minor matter.

Marissa turned to the nurse. "Can you grab the medical kit,please?"

The nurse pointed at herself. "Me? You want me to get it?"

Noticing the nurse's alarm, Marissa didn't press
further.

"Dr. Griffin," the nurse said, seeking Christy's guidance.

At Harmony Hospital, once a family member signed the surgical consent form, the doctors were free to proceed without hesitation. Even if the patient didn't survive, the hospital was legally in the clear-the signature meant the family had accepted the risks.

Still, Rita's condition hadn't worsened to the point of needing immediate surgery, and the female doctor preparing to treat her might be an intern.

The family's decision was nothing short of reckless.

"Should I call Dr. Wallace to come over?" the nurse asked carefully. "He has been overseeing Mrs. Curtis'case from the start and knows her situation best."

If any available doctor could handle the case, why did hospitals even have specialized departments?

The fifth floor, while staffed with competent doctors-many of whom were from the emergency unit-couldn't guarantee that any intern was up to the task.

"If you insist on doing things your way, can you take responsibility for the outcome?" Christy asked sharply,her suspicion rising.

Her distrust of Marissa's presence on the fifth floor
had already taken root. She was convinced Marissa had come with hidden motives. When Marissa didn't object to the nurse's idea of calling Maxton, Christy's suspicions deepened-she was certain Marissa's interest lay with him.

As Maxton's father's student, Christy felt a personal duty to shield him from romantic entanglements.

"Let us do it her way. I would like to see whether she is truly capable." Christy deliberately avoided mentioning Maxton by name, hoping the nurse would infer her meaning.

While the nurse went to retrieve the medical kit,Marissa quietly stepped closer to the bed.

Having taken medicine, Rita's color had returned, her breathing even and calm. She seemed peacefully asleep-a rare state for someone her age.

Waking her now might leave her restless and wide awake all night.

"Mrs. Curtis is resting soundly. Unless her condition changes unexpectedly, she will likely stay asleep for another forty minutes. Are you sure you want to wake her?" Marissa asked softly, glancing at Holley, who had drawn near.

###Chapter 19 Have We Met Before


"How can you be so sure?" Holley's gaze brimmed with doubt.

In all her experience, no doctor had ever claimed to know precisely when a patient would stir from slumber.

"Whether or not she receives treatment, the result stays largely the same," Marissa responded coolly,with no intention of delving deeper.

Given that Holley had no medical expertise,her efforts to explain would be futile. She reasoned that her brothers had likely settled Rayden in his hospital room,and she was ready to depart.

As the nurse stepped away, Marissa made to follow. To Christy, the truth was glaring-Marissa was here for Maxton!

Fury surged within Christy, barely contained despite several steadying breaths.

As Marissa moved toward the exit, Christy barred her way. "You are just fabricating nonsense! Are you even assigned to the fifth floor? Why are you poking your nose where it doesn't belong?"

The nurse, still nearby, rushed back to restrain Christy,
gently urging, "Dr. Griffin, calm down! I'll fetch the director and Dr.Wallace!"

The nurse only sought to defuse the tension, but Christy's anger flared hotter at the attempt to soothe her.

"No! Don't bring them into this!"

Christy refused to let Maxton be summoned,partly because she dreaded losing her composure in his presence.

And even with Marissa's face half-hidden by a mask,her visible features hinted at striking beauty. Christy feared Maxton would be interested in her.

"You don't even know my family's condition, yet you stop the nurse from calling Dr. Wallace. What do you mean by that?" Holley shot a frustrated glare at Christy. "You must be a terrible doctor! Did you buy your deputy chief doctor title? An intern doctor can glance at my family and know her state, but you, a so-called deputy chief doctor, just fire off questions without even checking her first! Calling you incompetent is putting it kindly!"

Christy, still fixated on Marissa, was caught off guard by Holley's sudden attack. Frowning, she retorted,"It is standard protocol! I also said if you don't want to repeat yourself, another family member could step in."
As long as Maxton stayed out of it, CChristy clung to some semblance of reason. Between Holley and Marissa, she knew who posed the greater threat, and her focus remained locked on Marissa.

Still, her irritation with Holley lingered. Having worked at Harmony Hospital for years, Christy was a standout among the younger doctors, second only to Maxton,with patients travelingfar to consult her.

To be branded incompetent by a young woman was a deep insult.

If not for her need to confront Marissa, she would have clashed with Holley on the spot. How dare Holley question her medical skills!

Her face reddened, her expression contorted, her entire demeanor sharp with rage.

"Stay here. Wake my family up. We have other matters to attend to," Holley said urgently, grabbing at Marissa's sleeve, desperate to keep her from leaving.

She needed to return to Marc's home before he and the others arrived, but if Rita remained asleep, her next steps would falter.

"You, grab the medical kit now," Holley ordered the lingering nurse. "What's wrong with you? She told you to get it. Why are you still standing here? Hury up!"
The nurse quickly released Christy and darted off.

"Don't call Dr. Wallace over!" Christy snapped at the nurse, anxious she might bring Maxton. She was irritated that the nurse complied with Holley.

"Look at how rattled you are!" Holley said, seeing through what Christy had in mind. Studying Christy's face, she sneered, "You don't strike me as Maxton's type. Compared to his past girlfriends, you're lacking in allure."

In her youth, Holley had harbored feelings for Maxton,but he was ruthless to those he didn't favor, and Holley, used to being the center of attention,wouldn't chase someone uninterested.

To her, Theodore was simply/ a smarter investment than Maxton; he didn't have a trail of exes.

At the thought of Theodore, Holley's mood soured,recalling Marissa being taken home. With a jealous edge, she muttered, "Can't I just wake my family myself?"

Marissa deftly grasped Holley's hand,preventing her from touching Rita, and said evenly, "She is in a deep sleep now and won't rouse easily. My specialized approach is the most effective way to achieve results.But if you want to try waking her yourself,be my guest."
Holley sensed something familiar in Marissa's quick,precise movements. Looking up, she asked, "Have we met before?"
###Chapter 20 I Doubt You Can Do It


Marissa had merely slipped on a wig and swapped her outfit,leaving her makeup unaltered.

Any other Curtis family member would have instantly recognized her as Marissa, but Holley was completely oblivious.

She failed to link the young doctor before her with Marissa.

"I'm pretty sure we've only just met today," Marissa said, a faint smirk tugging at her lips beneath her mask as she glanced at Holley.

She was amused that Holley still hadn't recognized her and silently pegged her as utterly clueless.

Holley was not convinced, reaching for Marissa's mask while muttering, "You seem so familiar."

"You're confusing me with someone else," Marissa said, deftly blocking Holley's hand. Her voice was icy as she added, "Please don't touch me."

Then she let go of Holley's hand.

"Argh, it hurts," Holley whined, shaking her stinging hand.
From the sidelines, Christy let out a sharp, mocking laugh.

"What, you think this is funny?" Holley's face twisted with fury. In a flash, she grabbed the medical record book from Christy's hand and smacked it across her face, her voice venomous. "Who do you think you are,sneering at me?"

Christy, stunned by Holley's swift aggression, hadn't seen it coming. The medical record book's metal clip grazed her cheek, leaving a stinging red mark.

Holley smirked with glee at the sight. Though petite compared to Christy, her commanding presence loomed large as she kept smacking the medical record book against Christy's face, her wicked grin widening."Go on, laugh! What's stopping you now?"

"You!" Christy fumed, yanking out a compact mirror she carried. Spotting the red streak from her eye to her jaw, her eyes blazed with rage.

"What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?" Holley, a seasoned bully, saw no fault in her actions, her arrogance only growing.

Christy boiled with anger but held back. The Curtis famnily's influence forced her to choke down her fury.

Her fists tightened, aching to lash out, but she restrained herself.
"Give me back the medical record book!" Christy snarled through gritted teeth, her voice thick with loathing, wishing she could rip Holley apart.

"I won't. What are you going to do?" Holley taunted,dangling the medical record book with no intention of giving it back.

Marissa watched Holley's antics, thinking this drama was a pointless drain on her time.

Having unloaded her rage on Christy, Holley felt lighter and found Marissa intriguing, eager to befriend her.

But as she opened her mouth, Marissa turned to leave without a word. "Where are you going?" Holley snapped.

"I've got things to do," Marissa replied coolly.

"How about we swap numbers? I could hook you up with some cute guys next time," HHolley said, pulling a custom pink business card from her purse and offering it with a cheeky smile. "I'm Holley Curtis, and this is my phone number."

Marissa raised an eyebrow at Holley's boldness but,recalling her earlier cruelty toward Christy, shook her head. "Hospital rules forbid us from sharing contacts with patients' families."

"What's the big deal?" Holley pressed, shoving the
card forward.
Marissa eyed her for a moment, then took it with slender fingers.

The light pink card screamed Holley's style.

Christy, feeling ignored, was seething with frustration.

"You were so sure your fancy treatment would wake Mrs. Curtis, but now the nurse is grabbing the kit, and you're slipping away. Scared you'll be exposed as a fraud? You realized you're not up to the task, huh?"Christy spat at Marissa.

Too wary to challenge Holley, Christy had no issue targeting the intern.

"You seem to know best-why don't you handle it?"Marissa said, arms crossed, unfazed by Christy's provocation, recognizing her as someone who preyed on the weak.

"Alright!" Christy hissed.

Marissa leaned against the doorframe, her tone flat."Go for it."

Waking Rita early wasn't complex.

"No. I doubt you can do it," Holley replied, her voice laced with skepticism.
###Chapter 21 Christy's Speculation


Holley shot a venomous glare at Christy, her temper flaring.

Christy struck her as a novice, someone who had likely coasted into the hospital through connections. Her medical expertise was questionable.

"Any half-decent doctor could outshine you!" Holley's voice oozed contempt, her words sharp with mockery."And you claim to be an associate chief doctor?Unbelievable! Do you think you're on par with Dr.Moore or Maxton? Look at yourself-do you even come close? It's pathetic."

Christy's blood boiled, her patience with Holley utterly spent.

It would have helped if someone had stepped in to defuse the tension, but the fifth floor was a ghost town -doctors and nurses were at their stations, not wandering without orders.

No one was around to rein in Christy, who was teetering on the edge of an outburst.

"Now that you don't trust me, I'll leave then," Christy snapped, her rage giving way to an eerie calm. She
wanted to tend to her scratched face first, done with trading barbs with Holley.

"Go ahead. No one is begging you to stay," Holley sneered, tossing the medical record book at Christy.Not satisfied, she hurled another insult, spitting,"Get lost already-your face is an eyesore!"

"You!" Christy scrambled to catch the medical record book. As she looked up, her eyes narrowed at Marissa's outfit. "Are you even a real doctor? Your outfit doesn't resemble ours at all. There's not even a hospital logo on them. You're an imposter, aren't you?You've been trying to slip awvay multiple times! You don't know the first thing about medicine, do you?"

Caught up in her accusation, Christy barely noticed the pain from her own bruised face, her eyes blazing with outrage. "No wonder you wanted to escape! You're a fraud!"

Marissa rolled her eyes at the accusation.

"She acts like she is so talented, but she is nothing but a fraud! And yet you treat her like some kind of star!"Christy fixed her stare on Marissa, expecting to see embarrassment.

But Marissa didn't falter.

Instead, she arched an eyebrow, her expression tinged with amusement as she met Christy's glare. "Dr.
Griffin, why are you focusing your attention on me?Save your interest for Dr. Wallace."

At the mention of Maxton's name, Christy went quiet,her eyes dropping to Marissa's attire.

There was no hospital logo, and despite the fabric mimicking their uniforms, it was clearly different.

This woman,so confident moments ago, was definitely not an intern here. The fifth floor had been secured by the Curtis family-how had she gotten in?

A startling possibility flashed in Christy's mind, but she pushed it away, unwilling to entertain it.

Her suspicious glances at Marissa persisted, as if trying to pierce through her facade.

Could she be Dr.Moore?

Marissa's smile didn't waver as she held Christy's fleeting gaze. Their eyes met, each studying the other.

Unable to maintain eye contact for more than a moment, Christy averted her gaze, her face turning aside.

"If you're not a doctor here, just get out. I'm letting you off easy since we're both women. If the hospital administration catches wind of your nonsense,they will drag you in for questioning! Hurry up and leave!"
Christy silently prayed this woman would vanish before Maxton showed up, terrified he would immediately guess her identity.

Marissa studied the fleeting emotions crossing Christy's face, offering a piercing stare before breaking into a slow, playful smile. "Dr. Griffin, you are so kind."

If she hadn't seen Christy's earlier outbursts, Marissa might have bought her fake concern.

"I'm only looking out for you. Our hospital has strict rules. Sneaking in with a fake uniform is a serious violation. Ifyou want a job here, check our official job listings. No need to creep in like this." Convinced she had pinned down Marissa's true identity, Christy's tone softened, though a trace of envy lingered.

"Come on, aren't you afraid she might steal your spotlight once she joins the hospital?" Holley tossed in a snide comment from the sidelines.

Marissa watched Christy's face cycle through emotions in seconds.

Fury clouded Christy's expression as she whirled on Holley. "Can you keep your mouth shut while I'm talking to her?"

"Excuse me?" Holley, stunned by the audacity, froze.

Marissa let out a soft laugh. "She is telling you to shut
up."

Holley's eyes flashed with disbelief. "How dare you speak to me like that?" Her voice was ice-cold as she raised her hand and delivered a sharp slap across Christy's face. "No one has ever disrespected me like that! Telling me to shut up? Who do you think you are?I have to teach you a lesson today!"
###Chapter 22 What Does Her Tantrum Have To Do With Me


"Damn it! I've had enough!" Christy's patience snapped. She had never been so humiliated in her life.

Holley charged forward, her Taekwondo training fueling her confidence as she aimed a swift kick at Christy.

Just as Christy was about to lose control and fight back, the nurse who had run for help returned, trailing a group of doctors, Maxton among them.He barked,"Stop it!"

His commanding voice cut through the chaos.Amid the doctors on the fifth floor, Maxton's charming features were unmistakable.

Marissa spotted him instantly, but didn't linger on him,intending to slip away before the situation dragged her in deeper.

"Holley!" Maxton's long strides closed the distance as he yanked her aside, his tone icy. "How could you attack a doctor? This isn't your personal playground!"

Christy was an associate chief physician at Harmony Hospital and a protégé of Maxton's father. If his father caught wind of her being assaulted by a patient's
family, the lectures would be relentless.

"Apologize to Dr. Griffin!" Maxton pushed Holley toward Christy, his demand firm.

Holley squirmed, refusing to back down, her fury driving her to attempt a headbutt while hurling insults."You can't tell me what to do! Let me go, you bastard!"

Maxton calmly held her at bay, unfazed by her flailing,his voice cold. "Apologize, or I'll have to inform your family about this!"

"Go ahead!" Holley's eyes blazed with rage, practically spitting fire. "She insulted me first, and you're blaming me without even asking! That's ridiculous!"

Maxton knew Holley's stubborn streak well; when she felt wronged, she was unyielding. Her tears and outbursts didn't faze him, nor did her accusations. He stood firm. "Apologize!"

"I won't!" Holley bit out each word with defiance."She insulted me first. I've got a witness. Ask her-she saw it all!"

Holley jabbed a finger at Marissa, who had been observing the drama unfold, then added, "When Rita was brought in, you needed machines to check her,but this doctor just glanced at her and knew it was no big deal..."
"Enough!" Christy cut Holley off, stealing a nervous glance at Maxton. Seeing his focus wasn't on Marissa,she exhaled slightly, but his next words made her tense again.

"Are you a new intern?" Maxton turned to Marissa.

He had been abroad, swamped with work and out of touch with hospital affairs. He had only heard vague mentions from the director about promising new interns and assumed Marissa was one.

Her demeanor during the chaos, however, irritated him.

"You're all colleagues. Why didn't you intervene when a patient's family was causing trouble?"

Maxton's tone carried impatience; he hated handling petty disputes. His assistant was on leave, so calling him back wasn't an option.

Marissa gave him a lazy glance, her voice cool."What does her tantrum have to do with me?"

Maxton's expression darkened, and his voice dropped as he said, "You're colleagues!"

"And?" Marissa's response was breezy, her attitude nonchalant.

Christy, watching the tension spark between them, felt a thrill, hoping it would escalate.
She had known Maxton for years and knew his type-he couldn't stand women who defied him.

Even if this woman was Dr. Moore, Christy had nothing to fear.Maxton would never engage with a woman who had that attitude.

"Thank you, Dr. Wallace, for looking out for me.I really appreciate it," Christy cooed, her voice dripping with sweetness as she dropped her earlier sharpness,gazing up at Maxton with a fragile, pouting expression,tilting her head to highlight the red mark on her cheek for added pity.

Holley rolled her eyes so had they nearly vanished,scoffing at Christy's performance. "What's with the act? Weren't you just full of yourself? Now that Maxton's here, you're playing the victim? If a man really cares for you, he will like you as you are. Why fake it?"

Holley mimicked Christy's syrupy tone, tilting her head in a mocking imitation.

"Enough!" Maxton massaged his temples, clearly more exhausted by this drama than any academic debate."Dr. Griffin, go and treat your injuries first."
###Chapter 23 Would You Like My Assistance


Maxton's keen understanding of women was born from his numerous romantic adventures.

Out of respect for his father, he had always treated Christy with kindness.

However, observing Christy's behavior, he chose to maintain a strictly professional demeanor to prevent any misinterpretations.

Christy struggled to find words, stammering, "Dr.Wallace, l..." She had hoped to foster a closer connection with Maxton during this moment, but feared alienating him.

With Maxton present, she felt anchored, unwilling to leave.

Yet, his presence made her so anxious that she forgot all the excuses she had prepared to justify staying.

A nurse interrupted, announcing, "Dr. Griffin, I've brought the medical kit," as she wheeled in a cart.

Christy instantly gestured toward Marissa, and declared, "She claims she can administer a unique
procedure to wake Mrs. Curtis."

She then pointed at Holley, speaking to Maxton with a flattering tone. "She's on board too."

Maxton's expression darkened, his striking features clouded with irritation. Swallowing his rising frustration,he bent toward Holley and demanded, "Are you out of your mind? Rita's condition doesn't need medical interference!"

Holley retorted defiantly, "I'm serious! I have things to do with Rita!" She refused to disclose her true intentions and added, "Stop interfering. You can't assess Rita's state, but others can. What's wrong with me seeking her assistance? Let go of me!"

"You know Rita has problems with sleep, so what's the harm in encouraging her to rest more? You're the one who upset her, aren't you? That's why she fainted."Maxton's anger surged at Holley's irrational attitude.

He had withheld the truth about Rita's collapse from others to protect Holley's reputation. He hadn't anticipated her misjudging his expertise.

With a scornful huff, he pulled Holley to the bedside.His voice was icy. "This is your family.You need to look out for her. You're mature enough to grasp this!"

Holley shouted in exasperation, "It's not my fault!Marissa is the one who enraged her! Why blame me?"
From the doorway, Marissa arched an eyebrow,recalling that Rita was vibrant when she left with Marc and the others.

"Let's set that aside for now. Can you clarify the situation? You requested the medical kit-what's your plan? To use it on Rita? Our hospital has strict protocols; supplies must be used based on actual medical necessity, not personal desires."

The speaker was the fifth-floor director, a woman nearing fifty, whose professional demeanor conveyed seasoned expertise.

Her voice, unlike Christy's sharp tone, was calm,deep,and compassionate.

Fully aware of Rita's condition, she knew a skilled doctor could safely perform specialized treatment.

She had trailed Maxton, knowing his expertise in this area was limited and suspecting his pride might prevent him from seeking her input.

After all, Maxton was more famous than her.

Holley, exasperated by the relentless inquiries,snapped, "You doctors are infuriating! One questions me, then another repeats the same thing! I wouldn't have come if I had known it would be this ordeal!"

Her head spun, her expression bitter as she glared at
Maxton. "Why are you still grabbing me?"

Maxton's brow furrowed, his voice low and stern. "Stop messing around!"

Holley shot back, "I am not!"

Dismissing him entirely, she treated his words as meaningless chatter.

Turning to the nurse, she demanded, "Where is the medical kit?"

The nurse hesitated, glancing uncertainly between Maxton and the director, unsure whether to comply.

Holley snatched the kit from the nurse and approached Marissa,giving a sly wink. "You handle it."

Alarmed, the nurse shuffled to Christy and whispered,"Dr. Griffin, I remember you mentioning that the new doctor isn't on our staff. Is it safe for her to perform this procedure on Mrs. Curtis?"

The nurse feared potential complications.

Christy had believed Marissa was Dr. Moore,instinctively trusting her expertise.

Though Christy felt certain, the director remained skeptical. She gazed at Marissa, startledby her youthful look, yet refrained from condescension, unlike many senior doctors. With genuine concern, she gently
inquired, "Are you capable of handling this? Would you like my assistance?"
###Chapter 24 Rita Is Awake


The director's warm words immediately revealed that she was a kind soul.

"There is no need," Marissa replied courteously,shaking her head. To her, this procedure was as second nature as lacing up her boots.

Observing Marissa's self-assurance, the director held back from further comment, wary of disrupting her focus, and silently watched from the sidelines.

Christy, lost in thought, absently brushed her bruised right cheek with her hand.

When the nurse saw Christy's distraction, she hurried to the director and whispered urgently, "This doctor doesn't seemto be from our hospital! If the treatment goes wrong, won't the Curtis family hold us accountable?"

Harmony Hospital prided itself on employing highly skilled doctors, with even its interns being top-tier students from prestigious schools.

"Perhaps you should take over?" the nurse pressed.

The doctor missed some of the nurse's words, turning with a smile. "It's alright. Let her give it a try. There
shouldn't be any serious problem."

The nurse, growing frantic, glanced at Marissa, who was poised to begin the procedure. Stomping her foot in agitation, she raised her voice. "That's not what I'm saying! She's not from our hospital! We can't let her treat the patient!"

Misinterpreting the nurse's urgency as a trivial spat among younger staff, the head doctor furrowed her brow slightly. "It's fine. I'm here overseeing. Nothing will go wrong."

Marissa,fully prepped, stood ready to start.

The director's admiration grew as she observed Marissa's unwavering composure, undisturbed by the surrounding tension.

She leaned toward the nurse, murmuring, "Notice her technique-the precision, the control. It's remarkably skilled! She's a real talent. I must find out who trained her once she's done."

"Dr. Quinn!" The nurse was exasperated, realizing that Carla Quinn hadn't grasped what was really going on."The patient is a Curtis family member, someone prominent. If this treatment fails, we will be held accountable!"

The nurse was tempted to grab Carla's face to force her attention
"Enough," Christy interjected, shooting the nurse an irritated glance. "If something goes wrong, it's not on you. Why are you causing a fuss?" While fixated on Marissa's movements, Christy was annoyed by the nurse's exchange wth Carla.

The nurse felt powerless. Glancing from Carla to Maxton, she opened her mouth to protest but stopped,reassured by Maxton's presence.

Carla grew increasingly fond of Marissa's evident skill,captivated by the confident aura she projected.

Unable to hold back, she edged closer, waiting until Marissa neared the end of the initial treatment phase to ask softly, "Where did you study?"

As Marissa lifted her hand, Rita, whose breathing had been faint but steady, stirred her eyelids. The moment Marissa rose, Rita's eyes opened.

"Rita, you're awake!" Holley cried, bounding toward Rita with unrestrained glee.

Holley's careless enthusiasm disregarded everyone else's space.

Her sudden rush nearly caused Maissa to hurt herself.

Marissa, her face impassive, regarded the overly enthusiastic Holley and swiftly stowed the medical kit.She remarked coolly, "Her frail bones can't withstand
such careless handling."

She had no tolerance for recklessness.

"I'm not careless!" Holley shot back, her sharp retort dismissive of Marissa's recent assistance, as if it meant nothing to her.

Marissa's piercing, luminous gaze settled icily on Holley, her faint half-smile conveying silent reproach.

"You..." Holley stammered, inexplicably unnerved by Marissa's stare, and in her distraction, she stumbled over her own feet, crashing to the floor with a yelp

Maxton, observing from the sidelines with arms crossed, made no move to assist. His detached, frosty gaze lingered on Marissa's unmasked eyes, stirring a vague sense of recognition, as though he had seen her before.

Sensing his scrutiny, Marissa flicked her eyes toward Maxton, noted his contemplative look,and turned away with a subtle smirk hidden beneath her mask

She silently criticized Harmony Hospital's lax oversight,which permitted an uncertified doctor to treat patients.

"Maxton!" Holley cried out in a panic, her voice cutting through the air.

Her shout jolted Maxton from his thoughts, and he pinched his brow in irritation.
Holley's close bond with her sister came to mind. If Holley vented to her, it might lead to a nightmare.

Memories of past troubles intensified Maxton's headache.

"You're so careless. How do you trip over yourself?" he muttered, reluctantly extending a hand

But it was too late.

Holley instinctively reached for Marissa, who stood closest.
###Chapter 25 I Swear I've Seen You Somewhere Before


The room was spacious, as it was a VIP ward,yet Marissa couldn't avoid Holley when a small cart blocked her way, keeping her from stepping aside completely.

Holley's hand flailed desperately and caught the edge of Marissa's white coat.

Instinctively, Marissa stepped backward, tugging at Holley's sleeve.

A sharp ripping sound cut through the silence of the room-the buttons of Marissa's coat flew off one after another, and the material tore under the tension.

Holley, gripping a corner of the torn coat, lost her balance and crashed to the floor with a dull, bone-jarring thud that made the air feel heavy.

"Ah!" she gasped in horror.

Before Marissa could steady herself, the momentum dragged her down as well. She fell forward,landing squarely on Holley, who cried out in pain as the two hit the floor together.
They were close to the hospital bed, and as Marissa struggled to push herself up, something caught her wig.

The clips held fast, leaving it slightly crooked but still in place.

From that close distance, their eyes locked-Holley's widened as she stared into Marissa's striking eyes, a strange familiarity stirring within her.

"I swear l've seen you somewhere before," she murmured.

"I told you, you have me confused with someone else,"Marissa replied evenly, fixing her wig with a subtle motion and turning her face away as she rose from the floor.

The white coat, now hanging open and buttonless, was beyond saving, but she didn't bother with it.

The ward door stood open, and through it, the Curtis brothers could be seen helping hospital staff wheel the unconscious Rayden past.

Marissa had no time to waste; she turned to leave.

"You're just going to leave like that?" Holley called after her, unwilling to let go of someone who had just put Maxton in his place.

Ignoring the dull ache in her tailbone, she scrambled to
her feet.
"Maxton, do you believe me now? Didn't I tell you your hospital's doctors are useless? Look-Rita woke up!"Holley's face lit up with arrogance, her chin tilting upward in smug satisfaction.

"Dr. Griffin even said she couId handle it herself, but look at her-clearly, she can't!" Holley wvasn't finished;she turned her sharp tongue on Christy next. "I said she only got in through connections, but she denied it!Compared to this doctor here, isn't it obvious who's more capable?"

Carla, who had stayed silent to avoid arguing with Holley, finally spoke up when she saw Christy being humiliated.

Her voice carried the weight of authority. "Young lady,watch your words. Dr. Griffin is a top master's graduate and an excellent doctor. She has earned multiple commendations from patients. She just specializes in a different field."

Holley rolled her eyes, impatient and dismissive."Come on, save your lecture!"

Rubbing her sore tailbone, she turned toward Maxton again. "Well? Admit it already! Fire her and hire this woman instead as your hospital's associate chief doctor!"
She jabbed her finger toward Christy before pointing to Marissa, who was already outside the room.

"Hey, don't go! I'm trying to help you get a job!"

Marissa turned her head slightly, her tone calm and detached. "Just remember your promise."

"Of course! Don't forget to call me-and add me on WhatsApp!" Holley said eagerly, then rushed after her as a thought struck. "Actually,you add me first!"

She had a hunch the woman wouldn't reach out once she left.

Marissa merely shook her head, showing no intention of pulling out her phone.

"Which doctor's student are you?" Carla asked quickly,not wanting to lose someone so capable. Taking out her own phone, she offered warmly, "Let's exchange contacts. I can recommend a mentor for further training."

Carla's composed and trustworthy demeanor made a positive impression on Marissa.

She paused for a moment, then nodded and exchanged WhatsApp details with her.

"Wait, what? You added her but not me?" Holley pouted in protest.
Marissa was impervious to the whims of others'sentiments, rendering Holley's grievances utterly inconsequential to her. As she prepared to stow her device, an unmistakably masculine palm extended forth.

"Permit me to introduce myself-I'm Maxton Wallace.
I'd love to add you on WhatsApp,too." Maxton smiled.

"Hey!" Holley employed her petite build to shove Maxton from the scene, regarding him with evident contempt."Why are you adding her on WhatsApp,too?"

Maxton's demeanor hardened, his irritated stare settling upon Holley's visage. His voice conveyed a subtle frost. "This has nothing to do with you!"

Holley swiveled her eyes skyward in irritation, then turned to Marissa. "I would advise against linking with him.He is a womanizer!"
###Chapter 26 Is That You,Jessica Thomas


Holley tried to stop Marissa from adding Maxton on WhatsApp.

Marissa, however, had no interest in getting tangled up in whatever messy dynamics existed between the people in this ward. Everything she overheard passed through her mind like background noise.

She never had the slightest intention of sharing her contact with Maxton.

He was nothing like she had imagined, and she was thoroughly unimpressed.

Christy, on the other hand, was barely holding herself together.

She had once wanted to add Maxton on WhatsApp but failed; now, the man she adored had just asked another woman for her WhatsApp number-only to be turned down.

The frustration burned even hotter when Holley casually mentioned that Maxton was a womanizer.

Christy's heart splintered with jealousy.
Maxton, the man who always kept others at arm's length, was now showing rare warmth toward a stranger.

Over the years, Christy had never seen him speak so gently to any woman.

The sight made her jealousy boil over.

Every small motion Marissa made, especially the unhurried way she slipped her phone back into her pocket, felt deliberate to Christy, as if she was toying with him.

No, she couldn't allow them to connect!

Then, suddenly, a memory struck her.

If Maxton ever discovered that Marissa was actually Dr.Moore,she would lose her chance with him.

That couldn't happen.
"Dr. Quinn, Dr. Wallace." Christy compelled herself to stifle her genuine thoughts, mustering a forced grin. "I believe I overheard a nurse mention she is not from our hospital. The fifth level remains sealed off. How exactly did she gain access?"

Before Marissa could reply, Christy pivoted toward the nurse and instructed, "Proceed to notify the Curtis family to kick her out at once. She undoubtedly harbors ill intentions toward them!"
Christy's singular aim centered on eliminating Marissa from the scenario, guaranteeing no additional interactions with Maxton. She disregarded the potential repercussions of her presumptions proving wrong, particularly concerning a young woman.

"I suspect you're merely envious of her!" Holley experienced a wave of assurance upon noting Marissa's refusal to add Maxton to her contacts."Maxton,what is your view on my proposal? You ought to fire Dr. Griffin! She is incompetent and vindictive."

Holley persisted in her denunciations, her utterances cascading ceaselessly.

Marissa pondered how to respond to Holley's offer.Actually, she harbored no plans to join Harmony Hospital.

"Are you truly not from our hospital?" Carla hesitated to relinquish a promising prospect, desiring to retain her within their establishment.

"No," Marissa affirmed, averting her gaze to temper Carla's enthusiasm.

Carla exhaled profoundly, abstaining from hindrance,opting instead to counsel Christy. "Enough, the request stemmed from the patient's family member. You should not hold her accountable for it."

"Auntie!" Christy's eyes moistened, teetering on the
brink of weeping, unprepared for her aunt's allegiance to an outsider.

Carla's countenance hardened. "Maintain appropriate professional demeanor.Address me as Dr. Quinn."

Christy bit her lip hard, her face betraying both anger and embarrassment. Her gaze followed Marissa,unwilling to blink, terrified that she might still exchange contacts with Maxton.

Meanwhile,Maxton, who had just been turned down for the first time in his life, couldn't help but find Marissa fascinating. His eyes lingered on her for a moment longer before he awvkwardly slipped his phone back into his pocket.

Christy, who had pulled out her own phone in hopes of adding Maxton on WhatsApp, froze in place, her expression crumbling.

Across the room, Rita, who had just regained consciousness, looked disoriented. But the moment her eyes landed on Marissa's, her expression shifted dramatically. Panic flashed through her eyes as she exclaimed, "Who are you? is that you,Jessica Thomas?"

Her voice trembled, and she struggled upright, staring at Marissa in disbelief.

Marissa frowned in confusion. Jessica Thomas? Who
was that?
Still, she didn't dwell on it. Instead, she gave Carla a brief nod before walking toward the elevator.

"Rita, she is not Jessica," Holley hurried to say, gently steadying the old woman. "She is about my age-there's no way. You're mistaken. But I have to admit,her medical skills are amazing! You fainted earlier, and even Maxton couldn't wake you up right away, but she did it with her special treatment!"

Her attempt at comfort only made Rita's expression grow darker.

"What's her name?" Rita clamped down on Holley's hand with unyielding force, her tone laced with frost,prompting Holley to crease her brow in discomfort from the vise-like grasp.

Her stare lingered fixatedly on the door.

"I don't know!" Holley shook her head.
Marissa's figure disappeared from their sight. She took the elevator down to the parking level. Since Garry had taken her clothes, she needed to pick up something new to wear before she met with the Curtis family.

Meanwhile, Theodore, who had left a short while earlier, was just pulling his car into the same parking garage.
###Chapter 27 False Alarm


As Garry turned the ignition and prepared to drive away from the hospital, a familiar figure caught his eye -Marissa, standing alone at a distance. His gut tightened instantly. Could her cover have been blown?

Without a second thought, he snatched the trench coat from the passenger seat, jumped out, and sprinted toward her. Without a word, he threw the coat over her head and instinctively guided her toward the car.

Lillian, busy counting her paycheck in the back seat,nearly dropped the bills when the car door flew open and Garry ushered Marissa inside. Alarmed, she grabbed Marissa's arm and pulled her fully in, worry etched across her face.

"What happened, Marissa? Did something go wrong?The Brooks family is such a disappointment.Weren't they supposed to keep your real identity under wraps?" she asked, her voice tight with confusion.

Garry slammed the door shut, hurried around to the driver's side, and slid into his seat, his face dark with frustration. "Call Benny," he ordered sharply. "Have him hack into the hospital's cameras. We're leaving-now!"
He regretted ever agreeing to the Brooks family's offer.

Five times the pay wasn't worth this kind of chaos.

Cursing under his breath, he pounded the steering wheel.

It was too late for regrets now.

"Got it," Lillian replied, whipping out her work tablet and scrolling for Benny's contact.

"Chill. My identity is safe," Marissa said calmly, her eyes softening with faint amusement despite the tension.

"What?" Lillian froze mid-type and blinked. "Then why did Garry act like we were caught?"

Even Marissa couldn't explain it at first; his reaction had startled her too.

Smiling faintly at their worried faces, she said, "After you left, there was a minor incident-my lab coat got torn."

Garry let out a groan and smacked his forehead."Right. I accidentally packed your previous clothes instead.My mistake."

He had been too preoccupied thinking about dinner plans with her to notice such details.

Once he confirmed everything was fine, the tension
drained from his face.

"Marissa, do we still need to wipe the surveillance?"he asked, turning off the engine and glancing at her.

"Yes," Marissa replied. She suddenly recalled the name Rita had mentioned and turned to Lillian. "Hand me the tablet."

"Sure thing." Lillian passed it over immediately. She had just typed a few words when a flurry of notifications appeared from the other end.

Benny, known for his restless nature, thought something was amiss since Lillian used the company account to reach him.

Marissa typed out a message. "Look into a person called Jessica Thomas and share the details with me later."

Benny responded, "Marissa?"

She replied, "Yes. And take care of the hospital's security footage."

"Understood!"

"Marissa, do you still have plans tonight?" Garry asked with a hopeful tone, longing for a chance to dine with her.

"Yeah. I need to swap outfits and head back," Marissa
answered while peeling off her wig, revealing her hair cascading in graceful waves.

Garry wavered, curious about what business she still had at the hospital, but too shy to ask outright,so he glanced at Lillian for support.

Lillian, picking up on his cue, nodded subtly.

"Marissa, why are you returning to the hospital?" she asked bluntly.

Her youthful boldness allowed her to speak freely.

Marissa's bag of clothes rested on the back seat, and she changed into them without pause.

Garry, seated uncomfortably in the driver's position,averted his gaze to respect her privacy, his cheeks flushing.

"I just have some matters to handle," Marissa said vaguely, stepping out of the car, removing her mask and giving a casual wave to the pair. "You two should get going."

"Catch you tomorrow, Marissa," Garry said, lowering the window, his eyes lingering on her retreating figure,revealing his feelings only when she wasn't looking.

"Come on, show some guts!" Lillian chided,exasperated by his hesitation. "If I had a crush, I would be upfront, not tiptoe around like you."
Garry let out a quiet sigh, staying silent.

Instead of taking the elevator, Marissa slipped through the fire escape to Harmony Hospital's lobby, joining others waiting for the elevator.

"Miss Curtis," a warm voice called from behind as she stepped toward the elevator.

Turning, she saw Theodore approaching ina sharp,silver-gray suit.

"Mr. Brooks," she greeted.

"It has been a while, Theodore," another voice cutin,overlapping hers.

Maxton stepped out of the elevator, missing Theodore's greeting to Marissa, and extended a hand."Want to grab drinks tonight? Let's get some friends together. Betty would be happy to join uIs."

Marissa, uninterested in their gathering, proceeded into the elevator.

From inside, she glanced out.

Theodore's hand rested on Maxton's back, but his eyes trailed Marissa, a flicker of intrigue in his reserved gaze.

Her expression remained detached while his was coolly curious. Before any connection could ignite, the
elevator doors slid shut, severing the moment.

"What brings you to our hospital, Theodore?" Maxton asked.
###Chapter 28 Where's Your Sister


The Brooks family had their own private doctor, which was why Maxton found it strange to see Theodore visiting a hospital in person.

Who in all of Ozreka could be important enough for a man like Theodore, whose schedule was always packed, to come all the way here himself?

Could it be because of someone from the Curtis family? Maybe Rayden or Rita?

Maxton's brows drew together as he recalled his father's earlier call, the one urging him to come home because of the marriage alliance between the Brooks and Curtis families.

Was it Theodore and Holley they were talking about?

Among the younger generation of the Curtis family,Holley was the only eligible woman left.

Theodore and Maxton had been close since childhood.But as time passed, life pulled them in different directions, and what was left of their friendship now was mostly nostalgia.
As the elevator lights blinked upward, Theodore finally looked away and turned his attention to Maxton, who
was still dressed in his medical uniform. Adjusting his frameless glasses with a practiced motion, he said evenly, "I'm visiting Mr. Curtis."

Maxton froze for a second. So he'd been right after all.

Theodore's face remained unreadable, making it impossible to tell what he was really thinking.

"I see," Maxton muttered quietly. He wasn't interested in getting involved with the Curtis family again. He'd rushed back to perform Rayden's surgery, only to find they had already chosen another surgeon.

He wouldn't say he was furious, but there was still a trace of resentment buried inside him.

He didn't have time to tag along with Theodore either.His grandfather had heard that Dr. Moore was at Harmony Hospital and insisted on coming over, so Maxton needed to pick him up.

"You go ahead. I'll see you tonight," he said, holding up his buzzing phone. "We'll talk later."

"Sir, will you be going to the gathering tonight?" Wilbur asked.

"No," Theodore replied coldly as the elevator doors slid open. Stepping out first, he left no room for doubt. He knew exactly where his priorities lay between the Curtis family and the Wallace family.
The fifth floor of Harmony Hospital was exceptionally well soundproofed. With the door closed, not a single sound from Rita's room reached Rayden's room.

After Marissa gave her post-surgery instructions, Carla and the others arrived soon after to check on Rayden's condition.

The success of the operation spoke for itself.However,what truly left everyone astonished and secretly envious was how quickly the entire procedure had been completed.

"Dr. Moore's skills are on another level. It's a shame l didn't get to see her in action," said a doctor, adjusting his glasses with a sigh. "Do you think we could get him to give a lecture here someday?"

"Forget it," his colleague teased with a laugh. "Even Dr.Wallace hasn't had the chance to meet Dr. Moore yet.What makes you think you could? Are you richer or more influential than him?"

"Hey, can't I dream? You must be thinking the same thing I am-meeting Dr. Moore in person!"

The group of doctors exited Rayden's room in cheerful spirits. They hadn't seen Dr. Moore operate, but even his neatly written post-surgery notes had left a lasting impression.

The Curtis brothers, who were often scattered with
work, had all stayed back in Ozreka that day just to make sure Marissa didn't feel left out or unwelcome at home,

Once Rayden's stable condition was confirmed, they returned to their own affairs. Inside the room, only Corrine, who had just woken up, remained with a few household staff and the bodyguards stationed outside.

Ever since earlier incident, the bodyguards had learned their lesson, They now sat straight-backed outside the VIP suite, fully alert and unwilling to let their guard down even for a second.

When Corrine opened her eyes, a servant immediately approached with a glass of warm water, gently updating her on everything that had happened while she was asleep.

She'd only been resting for a little over an hour, but for someone who had been haunted by nightmares for weeks, it was the first time she'd woken up feeling somewhat at peace.

Knowing her husband's condition had stabilized,Corrine's focus quickly drifted elsewhere, She set down her cup, cleared her throat, and began scanning the room, looking for her daughter.

"Where's my child?" Corrine asked, confusion lacing her tone as she turned to the servant standing nearby.
The servant, who had just started her shift and didn't know much about Marissa, thought Corrine was referring to Andrew. Setting the cup on the table, she smiled politely. "Andrew had an exam this afternoon, so Danny drove him there."

"I'm not talking about Andrew," Corrine replied. "I'm asking about my daughter."

The servant blinked in confusion. "Madam, you don't have a daughter."

What daughter?

Corrine's expression hardened. "You don't know either?" she asked, turning to the others in the room.

Two of the servants shook their heads, while one hesitated before saying, "Madam, before I started my shift, my husband mentioned something about it, but we haven't seen anyone unfamiliar around here."

The woman speaking was Greta Tucker, wife of Brenden, the butler. She had heard about Marissa but had never actually met her.

Corrine's tone sharpened. "Where's my phone?"

"Here." A servant quickly handed her the fully charged phone.

Without wasting another second, Corrine tapped on Marc's contact and, the moment he answered,
demanded coldly, "Where's your sister?"
###Chapter 29 Corrine's Sadness


Inside the conference room filled with dozens of people, Marc suddenly raised his hand.

The new employee giving the presentation froze mid-sentence, panic flashing across his face. He thought he had messed up the numbers on the slides and looked helplessly at the senior colleague sitting beside him.

The senior colleague gave his hand a gentle pat,signaling him to relax and refocus on Marc.

Marc glanced at his phone and saw it was his mother calling. Without hesitation, he answered. "Mom?"

"Where's your sister?" Her voice came sharp and urgent through the phone.

"Isn't Rissa still at the hospital?" He pushed his chair back and stood, already heading for the door.

His assistant reacted quickly, opening it for him as Marc continued, "Calm down. Since Rissa's back with the family now, she's not going anywhere."

They had been careless not to exchange numbers with her earlier, and he was already regretting that oversight.
"I get it," he continued. "The banquet's all set. Once this meeting's done, I'll pick her up myself so she can get ready. Don't stress about Rita. I've already arranged for someone to stay by her side and keep an eye on things."

Meanwhile, on the fifth floor of Harmony Hospital,Marissa pushed open the door to Rayden's room.Inside, Corrine was in the middle of giving Marc a scolding over the phone, questioning how he could possibly lose track of his sister again.

Marissa's timely entrance stopped her mother from demanding that Marc drop everything and start a full-on search for her.

While still on the call, he had already sent Marissa's photo to all of the domestic staff, telling them to take note of her appearance.

In the Curtis household, all domestic staff were required to have priority notifications activated for their employer's messages.

So the moment Marc's message came through,every bodyguard and servant instinctively pulled out their phones to check. After glancing at the photo, they all quickly committed Marissa's face to memory.

When she walked in through the door, the two bodyguards sitting by the wall didn't react right away,
but as she got eloser, one suddenly sprang to hls feet,blurting, "Miss Curtis!"

The other followed immediately. "Good afternoon, Miss Curtis."

Having gone through a similar situation at the Curtis estate just hours earlier, MMarissa seemed far more composed now, quietly taking in everything around her.

"Your parents are inside," one of the guards said politely.

Corrine had been resting earlier, and with Rayden still recovering, the room had been kept quiet, so the door was closed.One of the bodyguards gave a quick knock before calling, "Madam, Miss Curtis is here."

Greta opened the door, and the instant she saw Marissa, her eyes widened slightly in surprise.

Marissa's beauty was unmistakable, and her resemblance to Corrine and Rayden left no doubt about who she was.

"Marissa!" Corrine's face brightened the moment she saw her. She quickly spoke a few words into her phone before hanging up and motioning for the servant to help her out of bed and into her wheelchair.

Marissa stepped closer. "I just had to step out for a bit," she said casually.
Corrine nodded and patted the empty space next to her."Come here and sit with me."

Marissa walked over while Corrine remained on the bed.

Marc will be here after his meeting to take you tothe fitting," Corrine said with a pleased smile.

Opening an app on her phone, she scrolled through a list of jewelry sets and turned the screen toward Marissa. "See anything you like? You can try them on later with the dresses."

Displayed were several luxurious collections, from elegant vintage pieces to sleek, modern designs. Each one looked like it could easily cost a fortune.

Marissa gave them a brief look but didn't show much reaction. She was never one to fuss over jewelry or fancy things. Apart from her passion for modifying cars, she preferred life to be simple and comfortable.Even the small studs in her ears had been an impulsive decision, encouraged by a stylist when she and Bryson were shopping for wedding attire.

"They aIl look fine," she said evenly.

Corrine's heart tightened at her daughter's indifferent response.

It was clear the Fletchers had never given her designer
things-she didn't even recognize the luxury brands on the screen.

Marissa, unaware of the storm her indifference had stirred in her mother's mind, simply nodded.

Corrine managed a soft smile and said, "Alright then.When you try on the dresses later, let the stylist help you pair the jewelry. You'll look beautiful in whatever you wear."

Corrine swallowed her thoughts, unwilling to say anything that might trouble her daughter.

She had once thought Marissa's smooth skin meant the Fletchers had treated her well, but now she realized they had only cared for her basic needs. In every other way, they had failed her.

The thought filled Corrine with deep sadness. Her daughter had been living in the same city for twenty years, yet they hadn't found her. The pain in her heart grew heavier with every passing thought.

Just then, footsteps echoed in the hallway outside. As Theodore neared Rayden's room, the door to Rita's room opened.

"Barry, are you sure these doctors you brought in are real experts? Marc has invited Dr. Moore for Uncle Rayden's surgery. Even Maxton is no match for that doctor,"
Holley's voice rang out as she stepped out first,followed by Barry and several middle-aged men in pristine white coats.

Barry had gone to great lengths and spent a small fortune to assemble this team of orthopedic specialists. Hearing Holley's tactless words, his expression darkened, but he held back from scolding her in public. Turning to the doctors instead, he offered an apologetic smile. "Please don't mind her. My sister doesn't always think before she speaks."
###Chapter 30 Shameless


"How coulid you say that about me?" Holley muttered irritably. She was used to getting her way at home,always talking back without worrying about the outcome."L."

"Enough!" Barry snapped, his patience finally wearing thin. He glared at her, his jaw tightening as he tried to keep his anger in check. How had he ended up with such a brainless sister?

If she weren't family, he might've already lost control.She never knew when to stop, always picking fights and never saying anything pleasant.

Holley wasn't entirely foolish, but she had her pride.Being shouted at by Barry in front of others stung deeply. "Fine! Go by yourself then! I'm not coming!"she snapped, spinning on her heel in fury.

Usually, Barry would have tried to smooth things over.She was his sister, after all. But not today. He had far more important things to handle. His tone turned cold."Then go back with Rita if you don't want to come."

He truly didn't have the patience for her this time. With Marc and the others out of the hospital, this was his chance to earn Rayden's favor, and he wasn't going to
waste it over Holley's tantrum. He needed to act fast before Marc returned.

"You!" Holley's voice trembled with anger, "Don't you dare ask me for help next time!"

Barry didn't even look at her. Keeping his composure,he addressed the group of orthopedic specialists politely, "My uncle's in the room next door.Please follow me."

"Fine! Whatever!" Holley snapped before storming off,

Barry watched her leave, but he didn't bother calling her back.

A dull ache settled in her chest. Barry's coldness stung more than Marc's indifference ever did, because Barry was her brother.

Holley muttered under her breath, "What a jerk," and kicked a trash can near the elevator.

She was already in a terrible mood, and Barry's attitude had pushed her over the edge.

"Ugh, stupid Barry!" she grumbled, giving the trash can another,harder kick.
Unbeknownst to her, Theodore was standing nearby.

His face was unreadable, his cold eyes landing on Holley's tantrum. He didn't speak; he just watched her,
Wilbur stood beside him and remained quiet,too.

Theodore's quiet authority was undeniable, and everywhere he went, people noticed.

A faint whiff of cedar followed him as he passed by.Holley caught sight of him and her anger melted away instantly. "Theodore!" she said, brightening as if her tantrum moments ago had never happened. "You're here to see Rita and Uncle Rayden, right? Uncle Rayden's in Room 501, and Rita's in Room 502."

Theodore glanced at her briefly, then looked away.He said nothing.

Holley, recalling what she had done, quickly bent down to right the trash can and wiped her hands clean with sanitizer from the dispenser near the elevator.

"Theodore, did you know that-" she began, but her words trailed off.

She'd been about to mention that Marissa had returned to the Curtis family, but the memory of Marissa's engagement to Theodore made her bite her tongue. Suddenly, she didn't want to say anything at all.

Theodore didn't ask what she'd been about to say. He didn't even seem curious.

That was just how he was-indifferent, detached.He
never wasted his attention on people or things that didn't matter to him.

Holley,however,kept chattering. Normally, anyone else would've said something in response, even out of politeness, but not Theodore.

To him, she might as well have been talking to the wall.

And that was exactly what drew her in. Holley liked men who were not interested in her. She found no fun in those who chased after her.

Theodore was like a distant star, impossible to reach,and she was determined to be the one to catch him.

Stealing him away from Marissa would make the victory even sweeter.

"Theodore," she said teasingly, "why are you so cold to me? Not a single word?"

Her tone dripped with sweetness, enough to make anyone cringe.

Theodore stayed silent, and Wilbur, on the other hand,nearly shivered from secondhand embarrassment.He wondered how Theodore had managed to endure it.

What Wilbur didn't know was, to Theodore, Holley's voice was nothing but background noise. He didn't even bother to acknowledge her.
But Holley didn't give up. "It's okay. I get it. People are always distant toward those they don't like." She gave him a small smile, undeterred. "I was so upset earlier,but the moment I saw you, everything felt better.You're my cure,Theodore. The only one who makes me feel better. Do you know what your place in my heart is? It's so special that-"

Her words cut off when she noticed Marissa standing by the door ahead.

She was leaning casually against the doorframe, her hands tucked into her suit pockets, watching them with a detached expression.

"Why are you just standing there?" Theodore stopped in front of her, his usually cold eyes softening just a fraction.

"Theodore!" Holley burst out, nearly trembling with frustration.

He hadn't said a single word to her the whole way here,yet the moment he saw Marissa, he spoke up.Annoyed, she let out a sharp snort. "Marissa, is it because you're useless that you got kicked out?"

Why did everyone always treat Marissa so well?
###Chapter 31 You Can't Steal Theodore From Me


Marissa flicked her eyes toward Holley, brushing off her biting tone, and offered Theodore a faint smile."It's too packed in there," she said.

Barry had brought three orthopedic specialists to the hospital. They huddled around Rayden, who had just woken up, and bombarded him with questions.

Marissa caught snippets of their conversation and noted their expertise seemed legitimate.

"If you can't fit in, just admit it!" Holley let out a sharp scoff and pushed the door open with more force than necessary."You had better spend more time improving yourself, Marissa. Being a Curtis isn't all glitter and comfort!"

She then lifted a hand to her mouth as if in mock surprise, her eyes gleaming with malice. "Oh, I nearly forgot-you just returned to the family, It must still feel strange walking in our world."

With a feigned sweetness, she deliberately brushed between Theodore and Marissa, her tone taking on a falsely cheerful tone. "Don't worry, Marissa. I've lived in Ozreka all my life, so if you need any tips-food,
shopping, entertainment-just ask me, I know this city like my own backyard. Your brothers are tatally out of their depth with this stuff-they even delegate picking flowers for their partners to their assistants, completely oblivious to what makes a relationship tiek, Oh,Theodore is cut from the same cloth!"

Marissa understood exactly why Holley had pointedly mentioned Theodore. With a sly smirk, she responded casually, "I appreciate the gesture, Holley."

Holley had banked on Marissa losing her cool, like she had done at the villa, snapping back and painting herself as a petty woman in Theodore's eyes.

But Marissa's poised and courteous reply turned the tables, leaving Holley looking like the childish one.

Holley darted a sneaky scowl at Marissa, chewing her lip in irritation, plotting how to unmask Marissa's darker side in front of Theodore.

"What's the matter, Holley? Are you not excited I'm back?" Marissa, a pro at flipping the script, stood tall,arms folded, flashing a cheeky grin.

Holley's face froze under Marissa's stare. She was caught off guard by her words.

With Theodore watching, Holley, though boiling inside,forced herself to keep her cool.
She twisted her head, shooting Marissa a menacing glare-this woman was her ultimate enemy!

"Holley?" Marissa stepped closer, tilting her head with a playful air.

"What's your problem?" Holley instinctively ducked behind Theodore, her pulse racing wildly.

The onlookers were baffled by Holley's reaction,especially Wilbur, who saw Marissa as refined and composed,

Marissa,reading the moment, grinned and locked eyes with Holley cowering behind Theodore, teasing, "What,are you not happy I'm here, Holley?"

Holley was so furious her teeth ground together, but she plastered on her usual sweet, charming mask for Theodore, letting out a few forced giggles before reluctantly stepping out from his shadow.

"Theodore," Holley murmured, hesitantly reaching for the edge of his coat.

As she leaned in, Theodore sidestepped sharply and gave Holley an icy stare. "Holley, you should not stand so close to me."

"Why?" Holley snapped, bewildered.

Theodore, uninterested in elaborating, glanced at Wilbur.
Clearing his throat, Wilbur explained, "Mr. Brooks is engaged to your cousin. He is your future cousin-in-law."

"What? No way!" Holley's head spun with rage as she stomped her feet and glared at Marissa with venom."You can't steal Theodore from me! He is mine!Marissa, please, don't take him-I can't survive without him.I would rather die!"

Holley wailed, lunging toward Theodore with open arms.

Marissa stood back, looking detached, as if he meant nothing to her.

Before Holley could reach Theodore, Wilbur stepped in."Please get a grip!"

"Who are you to tell me what to do?" Holley shoved Wilbur in a fury. "Get out of my way!"

She despised anyone who backed Marissa and stood in her way.

Wilbur, handpicked by Theodore for his exceptional fitness, smarts, and quick reflexes, didn't budge.

Holley couldn't move him and ended up sprawling on the floor.

A sudden chuckle rang out from Marissa.
Holley's shoulders shook with fury,her loathing for Marissa blazing. She looked up, her eyes dripping with malice. "This is all because of you!"
###Chapter32 What Kind Of Woman Was Marissa,Truly
"What has this got to do with me?" Marissa,clicking her heels sharply, approached Holley, who was disheveled and a mess.

Peering down at her, Marissa smirked. "Can't you be more careful?"

"Marissa, hold it right there!" Holley yelled after Marissa's poised, retreating silhouette, her voice sharp with indignation. "What is with that smug attitude? Theodore, she's picking on me!"

Unexpectedly, Theodore's typically stoic expression softened, a faint smile adding warmth to his usually reserved demeanor.

What kind of woman was Marissa,truly?
Holley's heart plummeted as she caught Theodore's smile fixed on Marissa's back.

Could Theodore actually have feelings for someone as brazen as Marissa?

No,she wouldn't stand for it!
Barry emerged, drawn by Holley's outburst. He was taken aback to see Theodore standing near Marissa.

How had they arrived together?
Unbeknownst to Barry, Theodore had picked Marissaup from the chapel. Barry assumed they were still strangers.

Was Theodore so quick to embrace a new fiancée?If not, why else would he visit Rayden at the hospital?

Barry's mind raced with questions. He glanced at Holley,who was still making a scene on the floor,and frowned, offering his hand. "Get up!"

"Barry!" Holley's voice dripped with grievance.
Barry understood her frustration but felt powerless.
Theodore seemed to have warmed to Marissa, a stark contrast to his earlier rejections of Holley as his fiancée.

"Get up first!" Barry urged, hoisting Holley to her feet before turning to Theodore. "Theodore,please, take a seat inside."
Inside the suite, he gestured for the staff to bring Theodore coffee, smiling as he added, "The hospital is hardly ideal for hosting. Next time, come to my café-the coffee and scenery there are unmatched."

Meanwhile, Corrine sat with the newly conscious
Rayden,while experts debated fervently nearby.
Theodore was known to the staff.

They moved to prepare coffee, but Greta intervened. One servant glanced back, confused,whispering, "What's wrong, Greta?",
After halting the servant, Greta approached Marissa with respect. "We'll prepare water for Mr.
Brooks.What would you like, Miss Marissa Curtis?"

Following the orders of those who paid her wages was Greta's forte.

She vividly recalled Marc's directive that Theodore preferred water to other drinks.

At her words, Barry stiffened, his posture rigid.

He couldn't challenge her in Theodore's presence,but his expression soured, barely concealing his irritation.

He hadn't anticipated Greta's blatant disregard for him, pivoting instead to Marissa, who had just returned to the Curtis family.

What was the meaning of this?
Was it Marc's order, or perhaps Corrine's? Or could it be Rayden's doing?

Barry's face darkened, his instincts pointing to Rayden's involvement.

Marc, in his mind, lacked such meticulous care;only Rayden, with his exacting nature, would issue such a precise instruction.

A sharp sting of frustration surged through Barry,and he dipped his head to hide the cold glint in his eyes.

Marissa, too, was caught off guard.

She felt the uneasy silence that Greta's words had cast over the suite.

Marissa gave Greta a measured glance, wondering if she was intentionally stirring the pot.
 
Then she said coolly, "Water will do." "Right away," Greta replied, her eyes flickering with unease as she looked at Marissa. In all her years serving the Curtis family, no one had ever dismissed a kind gesture from her the way Marissa did. A twinge of doubt crept in-had she made the wrong move? Marissa settled into a lone armchair, her composed demeanor laced with a touch of detachment.After addressing Marissa, Greta swiftly turned to Barry and Holley. "What coffee would you prefer,Mr. Barry Curtis? And Miss Holley Curtis, would you like your usual coffee blend?"

Greta pressed on with her duties, seemingly blind to the tension filling the suite.

Holley's fists tightened since Greta had paid ntion to Marissa fir
###Chapter33 How Could Marissa Execute Such An Impressive Move
"No need!" Holley snapped, her face hardening with defiance as she gestured sharply, barring Greta from coming closer.

Raised in a world where everyone catered to her whims, she had never been snubbed before.

Greta's decision to prioritize Marissa over her was utterly intolerable to Holley.

She shot Greta a venomous look and hissed, "Go grovel to Marissa! I don't need you!"

A more diplomatic Greta might have placated Holley, but her blunt nature led her to ignore the outburst. When Holley ordered her to tend to Marissa, she complied with a courteous smile and a warm,"As you wish."

Witnessing Greta choose Marissa yet again, Holley,consumed by fury, seized a vase from the nearby table and flung it at Greta's back, shouting, "You wretch!"

"Holley!" Barry roared, his voice thick with anger.
"Look out!" Marissa's gaze sharpened as she leapt
to her feet, swiftly pulling Greta to safety and shattering the vase with a precise kick mid-air.

The vase broke apart, shards scattering across the floor.

Marissa's movements were fluid and expertly controlled, hinting at professional training.Theodore's brow arched with curiosity, intrigued by what else Marissa might be capable óf.

Holley stood frozen, her hand still raised, stunned by Marissa's swift reaction.

How could Marissa execute such an impressive move?

How could she be so formidable?
Holley's breath caught, her chest tight with a mix of fear and jealousy. Something unreadable sparked in her eyes.

The sound of porcelain fragments hitting the floor reverberated through the room.

Greta, still reeling from the incident, stared at the broken pieces beneath her feet. She quickly guided Marissa to a safer spot, urging, "Watch your step.Don't get hurt."

Realizing what had happened, Greta didn't glance at Holley but instead thanked Marissa sincerely"Thank you for saving me!"

To Greta, Marissa's cool exterior masked a compassionate heart, making her seem almost angelic.

"Everyone, clean this up. I'll fetch some water,"Greta directed other maids.

She stayed near Marissa, her actions signaling her allegiance.

Just ten minutes earlier, the domestic staff had all received a message from their employer instructing them to show Marissa respect.

Holley spun around, noticing no one stood by her side-everyone clustered around Marissa. She pouted,muttering,"Damn it!"

Barry, preoccupied with other responsibilities,couldn't constantly monitor Holley. In front of Theodore and Marissa, he tugged his sister out,saying, "Go wait in Rita's room! Don't cause any more trouble!"

Holley scowled, hating being hauled around.

"What are you doing? Let me go. I'm staying!" she protested, shoving Barry. Then she called out,"Theodore! Theodore!"

She rarely saw Theodore, a work-obsessed man whose company was off-limits to her, and whose private homes she couldn't track down, even with a detective.

With Theodore present, Holley refused to leave.

Her strength and resistance left Barry sweating,forcing him to let her go for the time being.

"Can't you act sensibly?" Barry hissed through clenched teeth, warning her quietly.

Holley snorted, smoothing her rumpled hair and dress, lowering her voice. "You have your plans,and I have mine! Stay out of my way! And stop treating me like a child!"
"I have pressing matters to deal with. If you keep making a scene, I will freeze your credit cards! I'm serious!" Barry was fed up with Holley's obstinacy.

"Barry!" Holley gasped, shocked by her brother's threat. Her eyes widened. "How could you threaten to freeze my cards? I'm going to tell Mom and Dad you're dating that model!"

Knowing Holley for years, Barry had his methods to make her surrender. He leaned in, whispering, "Go tell Mom and Dad, and I'll tell Theodore about that college guy you're bankrolling."

"You!" Holley's pointing finger shook with rage. To stay near Theodore, she grudgingly accepted Barry's terms. "Fine, I'll behave!"

"You want to stay here?"

"Yes!" Holley nodded firmly, determined to remain close to Theodore and prevent Marissa from getting near him.

"Alright," Barry sighed. "First, apologize to Greta."

Holley asked incredulously. "You want me to apologize to a maid?"

In her eyes, her brother's request was utterly ridiculous!
###Chapter34 Putting On An Act


"Stop wasting time and apologize to Greta!" Barry snapped, clearly done with the back-and-forth.He threw Holley a pointed look, silently ordering her to follow. Then, turning away, he called out, "Greta."

Before he could say anything else, Greta's cheerful voice overlapped his. "Would you like some dessert, Miss Marissa Curtis? I made a batch earlier.Care to try some?"

Holley frowned. "She looks perfectly fine to me.Why should I apologize when she's clearly not hurt?"

Her tone stayed even, but the frustration behind her words was hard to miss.

Holley had too much pride to apologize easily,especially to a maid. Barry's response came like a slap of cold air. "Just go." Holley's expression hardened into cold severity as she followed Barry in silence. Marissa, who'd learned to anticipate trouble long ago, lifted her gaze as Holley approached. "Is something wrong?" she asked.
However, Barry stepped forward before Holley could answer. "Mind if I call you Rissa, like Marc does?"

His gentle demeanor and soft-spoken manner gave the impression of a harmless man, though something about the way he held her gaze suggested otherwise.

Marissa stayed calm,refusing to let emotion touch her expression. "Call me whatever you want," she replied.

Names, to her, were just words and nothing worth attaching meaning to.
Compared to Holley, Marissa was clearly the more obedient one, and Barry liked that. He had always favored those who listened. His eyes lingered on her bright face for a moment before he let out a soft chuckle. "Then Rissa itis." Marissa gave a faint smile but didn't engage further. Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Holley standing beside Barry with a tense jaw and pressed lips. She could already guess what they were trying to do. The siblings had always been skilled at putting on an act. Her eyes then moved to Theodore, lounging on the sofa, sipping his water with effortless grace, as if even that simple drink was something rare and refined.

"Greta," Barry called out again.

Greta, who was busy arranging snacks on the table, quickly looked up. "Sir, please give me a moment. Your coffee will be ready soon."

Barry's pleasant smile didn't waver as he gently rested his hands on Holley's shoulders. "Holley wants to apologize to you," he said in a smooth tone.

Holley?Apologize?

Greta nearly dropped the tray in shock. She quickly set it down and frantically waved both hands."Please, there's no need! It was just an accident."

She wouldn't dare accept Holley's apology. After all, she hadn't been hurt. Why make things awkward when she could just let it go?

That thought made her glance at Marissa with newfound fondness.

She was her savior, the one who shielded her from danger.

"You heard her," Holley jumped in quickly desperate to close the topic before Greta could change her mind. "She said it was just an accident,Barry."

Barry glanced toward Theodore, but seeing that he wasn't even paying attention made his expression darken slightly.

Finally, Barry let the matter drop. Since Greta had brushed it off, there was no point in dragging it further. He gave a curt nod and let go of Holley's shoulders.

Holley flashed a smug little grin and moved closer to Greta. "So, where's my coffee?"

"It's almost ready," Greta replied politely. Even though Holley had refused earlier, Greta made sure to prepare it anyway; she wasn't about to offend anyone.

Another maid watching from nearby couldn't help rolling her eyes.

To her, Greta's eagerness to please their employers seemed pathetic, as if she had no self-respect. Trying to make an impression herself, the maid straightened up and carried the cup over. She threw a glance at Theodore and pushed out her chest, lowering her voice as she said softly, "Miss Holley Curtis,your coffee." She thought she was being subtle, but everyone in the room immediately caught on to what she was doing.

Holley's smile faded.
Even this nobody dared to try her luck with Theodore now?

Holley said coldly, her voice low and dripping with warning, "Know your place. One wrong move, and you're fired."

The maid froze, her face blanching. Then, quick to recover, she forced a nervous laugh. "What do you mean? I don't understand."
Before Holley could say another word, the maid smartly turned and scurried back to her post.
Holley stared after her, with fury flashing in her eyes. Her grip tightened on her coffee cup,an idea sparking in her mind as the heat seeped into her fingers.

"Marissa," she called sweetly, walking toward her with feigned innocence. "Would you like to try my coffee?"

Her eyes sparkled with mischief, already envisioning how she would make a fool of Marissa before Theodore. Holley's voice turned honeyed and innocent, roy really happy to share treats with you." Then she gasped, her eyes widening, "Oh! Marissa, look out!"

She pretended to stumble, sending the steaming cup flying toward Marissa.
###Chapter35 You Still Don't Get lt
Holley's shout snapped through the room,freezing everyone in place. For a split second,no one knew what to do.

Then Theodore rose from the sofa, his face dark,ready to step in.

But before he could, Marissa shifted to the side with sharp reflexes, narrowly avoiding the cup of coffee that had been hurled straight at her.

Standing just a short distance apart, Marissa instantly caught on to what Holley was trying to pull. Despite her sweet looks, Holley had a nasty talent for scheming.

Pretending to lose balance, she made a show of stumbling forward. But when her plan failed and the coffee splattered harmlessly to the floor, she quickly straightened up, trying to salvage her act.

In that split second, Marissa made her move. She darted forward and kicked Holley's leg out from under her.

There was a loud thud as Holley dropped to one knee,the sound echoing across the room. Everyone stared in shock. All they'd seen was coffee flying toward Marissa and now Holley was on the floor, clutching her knee in agony.
"Ah!" Holley's scream pierced the air, her face pale as the pain hit her. Sweat gathered on her forehead as her breath came in short, trembling bursts.

"Holley!" Barry hurried to his sister's side, his calm mask breaking for the first time.

Marissa, calm as ever, crouched down beside Holley and brushed Barry's hand away with ease.Her fingers gripped Holley's chin, forcing her to meet her gaze.

"I warned you, didn't l? Just because you want something doesn't mean everyone else does. But you didn't listen."

Holley tried to fight back, but Marissa's strength,hidden beneath her delicate frame, was startling.No matter how much she struggled, she couldn't break free.

"Let go of me!" she hissed through clenched teeth."If you're brave enough, fight me properly!"

Despite her pain, her pride wouldn't let her back down.

Her voice was weak, heard only by Marissa and   Barry.

Marissa's expression didn't change. Her voice lowered, smooth but dangerous. "You still don't get it, do you?" Her smile was cold, her words sharp enough to draw blood. "Push me again, and next time, it won't just be your leg."

"Alright, alright, that's enough." Barry tried to defuse the tension, forcing a light smile even as the air around them bristled. "We're family. There's no need to fight."

But neither woman paid him any mind.

Holley's pain was quickly overtaken by rage. Her voice rose in spite of herself, trembling with resentment. "Do you really think Theodore came to the hospital because he wants you as his wife?Keep dreaming. Even ifyou weren't in the picture,there's still Betty. They were together for seven years. You're nothing but a cheap copy of her!"

It was the second time Marissa had heard the name Betty.

She released her grip on Holley's chin and gave her a light pat on the cheek.

"Whether he chooses me or not," Marissa said,smiling faintly, "has nothing to do with you." Holley winced. Her leg throbbed, and her pride was in tatters. "You're just Theodore's backup!" she spat bitterly.

Marissa arched a brow. "Why are you whispering?Scared Theodore might hear you?" She grabbed a fistful of Holley's hair and yanked her head up,forcing her to face Theodore. Her tone was calm,almost lazy, but her words carried an icy edge. "If you've got something to say, say it to him directly,not behind his back."

"You!" Holley shook with fury, mortified that Marissa was humiliating her right in front of Theodore. Rage burned in her chest, but she bit it down, forcing tears into her eyes.

"Marissa, how could you accuse me like that? I didn't say anything," she cried, turning to Theodore with tears brimming in her eyes. "You know me,Theodore. I've never lied to you. I've always tried to be good."

Of course, she had no plans to admit what she had really said. Losing face in front of Theodore wasn't an option.

Marissa merely scoffed and let her go.

Holley immediately tried to stand, but her injured leg buckled, sending her stumbling toward Theodore.
Watching her, Marissa folded her arms and smirked. Holley never wasted a single chance to cling to Theodore; she really was relentless.

And honestly, persistence could win over even the coldest man.

If Holley managed to melt someone like Theodore,maybe she actually deserved some credit.

But Theodore didn't give Holley that chance.Whatever little hope she had, he crushed it before it could even grow.

The moment Theodore stepped aside, Wilbur stepped forward, steadying Holley and helping her to the sofa.

Just then, the door to the suite swung open and a group of orthopedic doctors walked out.

At the same time, a knock sounded from the room.One of the guards opened the door, revealing a man with a cold, severe expression. Before the guard could even speak, Maxton's grandfather,Brent Wallace, shoved past him.

"Which one of you is Dr. Moore?" he demanded.
###Chapter36 Dr.Moore Is Here


The group of orthopedic specialists Barry had brought in exchanged surprised looks.

None of them had heard that Dr. Moore was at Harmony Hospital. They were told they'd be meeting Maxton, the promising young doctor who had recently returned from abroad.

They'd all heard of Dr. Moore's name, of course.His reputation had spread far and wide, but what was someone like him doing here?

Was he part of Harmony Hospital's staff?

It seemed Brent had rushed over just to meet him.
"So Dr. Moore is here, huh?" one of the experts murmured.

Everyone in the medical field knew about the case that had put Dr. Moore's name on the map, the one where he performed a leg surgery on an elderly man who had been paralyzed for years.

That single operation had completely changed how veteran doctors viewed young surgeons.
Before that, no one had even taken him seriously.To the medical community, Dr. Moore had just been another rookie hardly worth noticing.
When the news broke, the internet went wild.Articles, discussions, and speculation flooded every corner of the web. Some even offered outrageous sums on the black market just to uncover Dr. Moore's real identity.
Yet, despite the frenzy, no one managed to dig up any personal details about him. All they knew for certain was that the operation had been a resounding success.

One mysterious hacker even left a cryptic message online, claiming that Dr. Moore came from a powerful, mysterious family, and his background was so well-protected that it was impossible to trace.

Two years later, that same elderly man had not only recovered completely but was now living an energetic life. He often posted cheerful updates online-jogging, dancing, even hiking-proof of Dr.Moore's extraordinary skill.
"Wait, did Dr. Moore perform Mr. Rayden Curtis's surgery?" one of the doctors blurted out, his eyes lighting up as he tried to move closer to get a look at Rayden's leg, only to be stopped by his colleague. The Curtis family wasn't exactly the kind of people you approached without permission.

Curiosity alone wasn't enough reason to take liberties here.

Barry, meanwhile, looked completely out of his depth. Holley had mentioned Dr. Moore before but hadn't gone into much detail, and now seeing Brent rush in like that only added to his confusion.

"Mr. Barry Curtis," one of the doctors began carefully, taking the hint from his peers. "Dr.Moore's skills are truly extraordinary. With him in charge, your uncle's recovery should be swift." He hesitated before adding, "Would it be possible for you to share Dr. Moore's contact details with us?We'd love to consult him if he's willing."

People always said that learning never really stopped. Even the most confident experts, those used to being admired, would lower their pride and ask questions when they met someone genuinely skilled.

"That's such a relief to hear," Barry replied with a tight smile, deliberately ignoring the expert's probing question.

He didn't have Dr. Moore's contact number, nor did he realize that Dr. Moore was the one who had performed Rayden's surgery.
But how could he possibly admit that now?
"You didn't see Dr. Moore?" Brent asked as he strode in, his sharp tone cutting through the silence.

The experts instantly recognized Brent, a respected veteran in their field, and one of them quickly replied, "No, sir. We arrived after Mr.Rayden Curtis's operation was completed. The procedure was flawless, and the suturing was impeccable. Dr. Moore has incredible technique. In all my years in medicine, l've never seen such precision."

Brent'sbrow furrowed as suspicion flickered in his eyes. He had a feeling that Dr. Moore was still around.

But who could it be?

His sharp gaze moved across everyone in the room,studying each face.

Theodore? Unlikely. He had never shown the slightest aptitude for medicine. Definitely not him.

When Brent's gaze landed on Holley, he frowned."Holley/? Don't tell me you've been missing lectures again?" Holley, who was rubbing her injured leg, turned pale. Her studies revolved around medicine and Brent was one of her professors.

"Dr. Wallace, as soon as the surgery was done, Dr.Moore left. I didn't even get a chance to see him,"she said quickly, cutting him off before he could start one of his usual long lectures. "I only came because Rita was brought to the hospital. My cousin made her so upset that she actually fainted."

When her eyes landed on Marissa standing close to Theodore, anger flared in Holley's chest. If not for her injured leg, she would've marched over and pulled them apart.
Maxton hadn't said a word about any of this to Brent. He wasn't the type to gossip or get involved in family drama.

"What exactly happened? How did Rita faint? Is she alright now?" Brent asked.

His flood of questions only made Holley more frustrated. "You should ask my cousin," she said quickly, biting back the pain. "She came earlier, so she might have seen Dr. Moore."

Deep down, she was certain Marissa had no idea who Dr. Moore even was. "What's wrong with your leg?" Brent's eyes narrowed as he noticed the dark bruises marring Holley's knee.

No one had bothered to ask before, but now that the question was out, Holley couldn't hold back any longer. Tears welled up quickly and slid down onto her hands.

Seeing her like this, Brent's heart ached. He felt a pang of protective sympathy. After all, he had always treated Holley like his own granddaughter.He turned to Maxton, who was standing quietly beside him, and instructed gently, "Go get an ice pack."

"Okay," Maxton replied, his expression calm as his eyes briefly flicked to Holley's injured knee. The bruises looked fresh, and for a moment his gaze lingered on Marissa, who remained composed and unruffled nearby. He wondered silently who she was.
###Chapter37 Marissa, Are You Dr.Moore


Marissa stood to the side, arms folded, her expression detached, as if the discussion about Dr.Moore had nothing to do with her.

Wilbur arranged two chairs for Theodore and Marissa to sit in.

Theodore settled into his seat with ease.

"Thank you," Marissa said courteously.

"My pleasure," Wilbur replied with matching politeness before taking a spot beside Theodore.

The room buzzed with activity. Greta and several maids approached Marissa. "Should we offer coffee to the visitors?"

"No need," Marissa replied, waving them off.

They were here for Dr. Moore, and since he wasn't present,they would likely leave soon.

"Marissa," Holley called out, seizing any chance to stir trouble for Marissa.

Noticing Holley's persistent need to involve her,Marissa smirked. "Go on." She was curious to see Holley's next move.

Brent, following Holley's glance, spotted Marissa nearby, his polished features registering surprise.

"Marissa, what are you doing here? Are you here with Bryson for another check-up?" he asked,puzzled.

His gaze shifted to the person beside Marissa,realizing it wasn't Bryson and failing to place the unfamiliar face.

"Or are you here to join the crowd, curious about Dr. Moore's appearance? You young ladies often prioritize looks, but character matters most in a partner!"

To Brent, Bryson's character left much to be desired.

Holley,ready to complain about Marissa to Brent in hopes he would understand her grievances, was cut off by his surprised tone.

Brent knew Marissa? Who was Bryson? Did Marissa have a boyfriend?

Intrigued, Holley's eyes darted between Brent and Marissa, unable to piece their connection together.
"Dr. Wallace, how do you know Marissa? Is she your student too?" Holley wondered why she had never noticed Marissa at the university, given her striking appearance.

Brent chuckled at her questions, offering no further clarity. His eyes held a spark of curiosity as he regarded Marissa. "So, you're the long-lost daughter of the Curtis family. I was close with your grandfather."

Holley's heart sank at Brent's warm tone toward Marissa. Did even Brent favor her?

Damn it! She gripped her head in frustration.
"Is that so? I'm afraid I don't know much about my grandfather's life," Marissa replied.

Brent laughed warmly, unbothered by her cool demeanor.

It was clear that Brent genuinely admired Marissa,despite her aloofness.

One of the experts blurted out, "Dr. Wallace, is she Dr.Moore?"

He couldn't otherwise explain Brent's special treatment of this young woman.

If Dr.Moore was a woman, he imagined she would carry a similar presence-calm and untouched by the world. The expert's words ignited something in Brent. He had never linked Marissa to Dr. Moore before, given the latter's elusive reputation.

But the idea, once planted, began to align.

Marissa mirrored Dr. Moore in several ways,especially her medical talent.

Brent's sharp gaze lingered on Marissa, wondering if she was really Dr.Moore.

Marissa sensed the scrutiny but remained unruffled, continuing her actions without a hint of concern for the curious stares.

No one asked her directly, so Dr. Moore's true identity remained a mystery.

"Isn't Dr. Moore supposed to be a man?" one of the experts exclaimed, eyeing Marissa's youth and beauty with disbelief. "It's hard to believe such surgical precision could come from a woman."

He could accept that there was someone with skills superior to his, but not someone younger-or female.

"Bias stems from narrow minds and shallow knowledge. Women had achieved no less than men in history," Brent scolded, his tone earnest as he addressed the expert's sexism. "Prejudice is unacceptable."
The expert, chastised, felt a twinge of embarrassment.

Brent quickly moved on, redirecting his attention."Marissa,are you Dr. Moore?"
###Chapter38 Probing Questions


"If that's really the case, this new drug we're about to launch is going to sell like hotcakes," Brent said with a laugh.

On the surface, it sounded lighthearted, but the keen glint in his eyes suggested he was testing Marissa.

Marissa had collaborated with Brent for more than a year, yet their conversations had been rare.Despite his outwardly casual attitude, their bond wasn't exactly close.

At least, that was how she sawv it.

Marissa knew Brent was probing, likely suspecting she had something to do with Dr. Moore.

"Are you suggesting we hike the price of the medicine, Dr. Wallace?" Marissa asked, a subtle change crossing her face as she picked up on his hint.

The price had already been decided. Since the medicine would be needed by many, they had set it reasonably to avoid making it unaffordable for some families. In past discussions, Brent had hinted that the price was too low and nudged the idea of aiming for a more upscale market.

As the lead researcher, Marissa had the final say.She firmly rejected his suggestion, never expecting him to bring it up again, especially now, under the assumption she was Dr. Moore.

Both were skilled at reading people, each attempting to figure out the other's true motive.

"The price is finalized and filed. How could we possibly change it now?" Brent said, recognizing she didn't want to discuss this publicly. He smoothly shifted the topic, adding, "It'd be fantastic if you were really Dr. Moore!"

Brent had a way of saying things that carried deeper meaning.

Onlookers around them immediately started connecting the dots, convinced Marissa might really be Dr. Moore.

Shock rippled through the room.

Holley's jaw dropped.

This was absurd!

There was no way it could be true. Quickly, she blurted out, "Dr. Wallace, you've got the wrong person. My cousin isn't Dr. Moore. She doesn't know a thing about medicine. She just returned to the family today. She probably doesn't even know Dr. Moore."

Even as she spoke, a knot of unease twisted in her stomach, afraid that Marissa might speak up and reveal that she was actually Dr. Moore.

Brent seemed unconvinced. "Could I really be wrong?" he muttered.

He continued his subtle questioning, "Marissa,didn't you mention your major to the Curtis family?"

He figured the Curtis family had brought her in now purely for the new drug patent.

Otherwise, why else would they do so at this exact time?

"Dr. Wallace, you're really mistaken!" Holley said,keeping her voice calm though her heart raced.

What was happening here? Why did Brent seem so familiar with Marissa and speak of her with such respect?

Could Marissa really be Dr.Moore?

And would Theodore think the same? After a moment, Holley decided to clarify further."Dr. Moore is a young woman, but she's not my cousin! She has short hair. My cousin, on the other hand,has long hair."

Brent's eyes sharpened. "You've actually seen Dr.Moore?" His curiosity piqued, he leaned closer."Did you get any contact information?"

Holley hesitated, unsure if she should keep up the story. Seeing Theodore's eyes on her, she steeled herself and nodded. "I've seen her, but I didn't get any contact details. She left right after treating Rita. She's very busy."

"It's very difficult to get an appointment with Dr.Moore," an expert interjected. "And we just checked Rita's condition, it doesn't require Dr.Moore's attention anyway."

That seemed like overkill.
"Just because you couldn't get an appointment with her doesn't mean we can't," Holley shot back.

Brent's doubt lingered as he glanced at Barry, who had remained silent. "Did you see Dr.Moore too?"

Barry, though convinced Dr. Moore had operated on Rayden, doubted Holley's claim. Dr. Moore was notoriously elusive... why would she suddenly help Rita? Was it possible her indifference was just a facade,hiding a kind and helpful nature?

Barry snorted under his breath.

"Believe it or not, it's up to you!" Holley huffed.She'd lied, but it annoyed her that no one trusted her. "When Maxton gets here, ask him. He was there with Dr. Griffin. If you don't believe me,check with them!"
###Chapter39 What Makes You Say That


Holley felt confident that Dr. Moore would remain undiscovered, given her mysterious nature.

Despite her persistent inquiries and offering her contact details, she still hadn't learned the young woman's identity or her affiliated medical institution.

She was unfazed by the possibility of her lie being exposed. If confronted, she would simply claim it was a case of mistaken identity.

Upon learning the names of his grandson and his pupil, Brent grew convinced of Holley's account and resolved to discreetly consult Maxton for further details later. "Well, Marissa, you're still early in your journey, and your potential could outshine Dr. Moore's accomplishments. I have faith in you," Brent encouraged. His animated gestures, however,gave him an odd appearance. Marissa, unfazed, responded with poised assurance, "Thank you for your kind words,"accepting the praise without a hint of bashfulness.As Barry guided several experts out, some lingered, reluctant to leave, partly to discuss a few things with Brent and partly intrigued by Marissa,whom Brent likened to Dr. Moore.

When Maxton returned with the ice pack, he noticed the suite was less crowded and handed the item to Brent.

Brent, preoccupied with kneading Holley's leg,nodded but grew solemn upon pressing a tender spot, asking with concern, "How did you injure yourself so severely?"

Holley grimaced, perspiring from the sharp pain that suggested a fractured meniscus.

"You need an X-ray," Brent insisted, attempting to assist her up, but noticing her inability to stand. He called, "Theodore, come and help."

Theodore glanced at Wilbur instead of moving.

Wilbur promptly stepped in, offering Brent a courteous smile. "Let me assist."

"Well done, Theodore, for knowing how to keep a proper distance from other women." Brent, far from upset, commended Theodore for respecting appropriate boundaries.

He recalled his granddaughter's complaints about
her ex-boyfriend's overly friendly demeanor with other women.

After entrusting Holley to Wilbur, Brent, easing his aching arm, winked playfully at Marissa. "Theodore is a better catch than Bryson. Ever thought of a change?"

Brent had hoped his grandson might win Marissa's heart, viewing Bryson as a frivolous charmer.

However, he was aware of the engagement between the Curtis and Brooks families and now had to abandon that idea.

His support for Marissa was almost perfomative,like a dedicated advocate.

Marissa, unfazed, declared, "I've already moved on from that guy."

The Fletcher family's prominence was less than Phil and Susanna assumed, as the wedding drama hadn't yet made headlines.

Surprised, Brent probed, "You and Bryson have broken up?"

"YeS,"Marissa replied evenly.

Pressing further, Brent asked, "After developing that eye medication for him, you're just walking away?" Brent viewed Marissa as a hopeless romantic,always prioritizing Bryson's wishes. If Bryson requested a specific meal, she would abandon her tasks to prepare it for him.

"I've returned to the Curtis family," Marissa stated plainly, offering no details about her relationship with Bryson and indifferent to Theodore's possible assumptions from Brent's remarks.

Her brief response stopped Brent from asking further; he knew she was reserved, never speaking ill of her family.

"Oh, I see," Brent remarked with a sigh, holding back further comments, though he secretly wished that Marissa would marry his grandson instead of Theodore.

"Theodore," Brent sighed again, reluctant to see Marissa claimed by him, hoping to secure an opportunity for his grandson. "If your families'engagement falls apart, my grandson might make a move then!"

In Brent's opinion, if Marissa and his grandson shared mutual affection, opting for the Wallace family over the Brooks family wasn't far-fetched.

Unlike the quiet Theodore, Maxton's shared medical interests with Marissa made him a more compelling match.

"You must be joking, Dr. Wallace," Theodore replied, his steady eyes locking onto Brent, his tone cool. "We will make sure to send you a wedding invite."

Brent shook his head. "I'm not joking-| truly want Marissa as my granddaughter-in-law. I don't think you two are a good match."

Theodore's gaze held firm, his face impassive, but his eyes sharpened. "What makes you say that?"
###Chapter40 What Do You Think


Brent wasted no time and went straight to the point. "You and Marissa are both quiet, reserved,and allergic to conversation. How's a relationship supposed to work like that?"

Pausing for a moment, he continued, "My grandson is completely different from you. He's witty,charming, and outgoing. Marissa should be with someone like him."

Standing off to the side, Maxton could only sigh quietly, caught between amusement and mild embarrassment. He had never once thought of pursuing someone else's fiancée. With so many women out there, why fight for one already taken?

He had learned long ago that life was best lived without unnecessary drama.

"Don't you think so?" Brent asked, eyeing Theodore, who had been quietly paying attention.Then, he gave Maxton a nudge, subtly urging him to step up and show some initiative with Marissa.

Maxton rubbed his temples in frustration."Grandpa, can you please stop stirring things up?" "Quiet, boy," Brent said, shooing him aside. Turning to Marissa, he softened his tone and smiled. "What about you, Marissa? What's your opinion?"

Marissa stayed silent, her eyes instinctively flicking toward Theodore.

"Why are you looking at him? You're engaged, not married. He doesn't own you. And come on,divorces are common these days. Don't stress,I've got your back. He wouldn't dare cross you." Brent frowned.

Brent already had a fixed impression of her in his mind.

To him, she was a hopeless romantic and too selfless for her own good, always putting her partner ahead of herself.

And ironically, Brent considered it a point in his favor. Smart women were harder to manage, but Marissa was pliant and easy to control.

"Theodore, can you give me an answer?" Brent asked, redirecting his question since Marissa wouldn't respond.

"I won't give up on Marissa." Theodore's reply was immediate-firm and final, without even a hint of hesitation. Brent's expression remained calm, but Theodore's blunt refusal upset him. "Why not? I think you should compete fairly with Maxton."

Brent genuinely thought it was an good idea, and the more he explained it, the more convinced he became of his own genius.

Her humble background and the constant presence of her fiancé were the reasons he had always considered Marissa an unsuitable match for his grandson. So, he had only teased her about becoming his granddaughter-in-law without ever introducing her to Maxton.

But now, things were different. After Marissa returned to the Curtis family, her background matched perfectly, and Brent suddenly found himself far more invested.

He believed Theodore's calm and collected nature made him a poor match for Marissa, as their temperaments were too similar.

Theodore was undoubtedly a decent man, free of any romantic gossip or messy entanglements.

That was exactly why Brent wished Theodore could marry his granddaughter.

Yet, now the two people he had handpicked as ideal matches for his grandchildren were now  engaged to each other and that was something Brent couldn't stand to let happen.

Holley, eager for things to go her way, looked at Brent. "Dr. Wallace, tell me honestly, does Maxton like my cousin?"

Maxton opened his mouth to speak, but Brent silenced him with a warning look. Then, with a light chuckle, Brent replied on his behalf, "Of course, he does."

"That's amazing! I'm so happy to hear that!"Beaming from ear to ear, Holley clapped her hands together. "Maxton likes my cousin, and she likes him, too. And I like Theodore. He'll definitely fall for me too. All of us will be happy! We can even have a double wedding! Oh, that would be so perfect!"

She twirled slightly, giddy with excitement."Marissa, you and Theodore have only met once.You don't even like him, right? So please, let me have him. I've liked him for so long. I really can't live without him. He means everything to me."

The way she spoke, it sounded as if she were asking to borrow a trinket, expecting Marissa to hand it over just because she wanted it.

Why should Marissa comply with her whims simply because Holley wanted something?  From what she knew of Corrine and Marc, she understood one thing: even if Theodore weren't in the picture, they would find other men to court her.So why should she give up Theodore, who conveniently kept the other men at bay?

Even if Theodore had a girlfriend named Betty,it was no big deal. As long as they didn't flaunt it in her face, he could have a hundred women for all she cared.

"What do you think, Mr. Brooks?" Marissa asked with a soft smile, her eyes steady on his as if daring him to respond.

Theodore met her gaze, his lips curving slightly. He said smoothly, "Our engagement is arranged by our families, and I have no problem with it."
###Chapter41| Believe That's Nlot Too Much To Ask
Marissa's thoughts flickered back to the lively exchange she had with Theodore in the car earlier that day.

Her sparkling eyes softened, a delicate smile spreading as her voice drifted out, light as a whisper."Really,Theodore?"

Theodore's enigmatic stare lingered, savouring the teasing tone of her words.

With a sudden, quiet chuckle, he answered,"Without a doubt."

Marissa shed her fleeting warmth,reverting to her cool, distant poise, her tone steady. "Then tell your girlfriend to stay away from me. I believe that's not too much to ask."

Theodore slid his unlocked phone toward her."Want to take a peek at my phone? See if I'm having intimate conversations with another woman?"

Though Marissa knew he wasn't a womanizer, his unguarded offer surprised her-handing over his phone so freely.

Her mind buzzed with questions, but her hand moved first, taking the device.

Seeing her accept it, Theodore quirked a brow but stayed quiet.

"Well played, Theodore!" Brent flashed a thumbs-up, his smile bright but his gaze chilly.

"All thanks to your advice," Theodore replied with polished courtesy.

Brent's expression soured, feeling his scheme had backfired, and he muttered as he turned to go,"You had best stay cautious!"

Marissa's slender fingers danced over the phone,and catching Brent's parting words, she glanced up with a faint smirk. As he left, she said coolly, "He is right to be cautious-I'm not someone he can fool."

Maxton, observing silently, sighed inwardly. The conversation ended unpleasantly. And he was left to clean up his grandfather's mess. "Theodore, Miss Curtis," Maxton said, nodding to both, his voice tinged with regret. "I'm sorry. My grandfather's getting old and stubborn. If he has caused offense,I apologize for him." Meanwhile, Wilbur, who had been helping Holley toward her X-ray, stepped back when she refused to comply. Theodore's gesture of offering his phone to Marissa had left Holley burning with jealousy and fury.

If looks could kill, Marissa would have been struck down a dozen times.

Why did Theodore's heart have no room for her?

Holley's eyes brimmed wth tears, her leg's pain rivaling her wounded pride.

As a doctor, Maxton couldn't let Holley's injury miss its critical treatment window. Glancing down the empty corridor where Brent had vanished, he said, "Holley, let's get that X-ray done."
Ignoring her protests, he lifted her and carried her out, his tone a mix of care and reprimand."Keep squirming, and I'll toss you in the hospital's waste bin. You don't seem to care about your leg at all."

"You jerk, Maxton!" Holley shot back.

With the drama settled and the others gone,Marissa handed the phone back to Theodore."Here."
 
"Put in your phone number," Theodore said,not takingit,gesturing for her to input her contact.

Marissa hadn't expected her first saved contact in her new home to be her future husband's.

She quickly entered her number and returned the phone.

Theodore glanced at the screen, noting the absence of a name, then looked up, studying her refined features before typing a single word,saving it, and dialing.

"This is my personal line. You can call me anytime,"he said, his deep voice smooth and warm.

"Alright," Marissa replied, saving his number. She caught a fleeting glimpse of his screen, but he hung up before she could read it.

In another room, Corrine was still engrossed in her meeting,unaware that Rayden had woken up.

"The second draft is more refined than the first, but the colors are off. Send it back for tweaks-this matte black looks terrible under light. Adjust it and get a new sample," she instructed.

After Theodore's arrival, Greta had quickly updated Corrine on the situation outside.

Assured that Marissa was accompanied, Corrine immersed herself in her tasks, unaware of Holley's taunts toward her daughter.

Later, with the room buzzing with people and conversations intertwining, Greta couldn't provide a timely update.

Meanwhile, at the Fletchers' house, Evelina, thriled by a text from Bryson, hurried to Phil and Susanna's room. "Mom, Dad! Bryson has invited me to a high-society gala tonight-what should wear?"
###Chapter42 HHas Marissa Ever Come Back
Susanna had basked in a life of luxury/for decades,free from the burdens of household or business affairs. Her days revolved around shopping sprees and lavish getaways with her friends or the wives of corporate allies.

They often met in small circles to focus on fitness and skincare, and even in her fifties, Susanna radiated the elegance of a woman a decade younger.

Evelina, however, couldn't match her mother's polished allure.

Despite the Fletcher family employing a skincare specialist and a personal trainer, they couldn't mold her into a refined socialite overnight.

Caught mid-yoga in front of a large screen,Susanna was taken by surprise by Evelina's words."When did Bryson tell you this? Did he say which family is hosting?"

Ozreka housed many wealthy families, but only a handful ranked as elite. Pausing to think, Susanna rose from her yoga mat and strode toward the walk-incloset, asking,""1Bryson still at the hospital?"

Evelina, still drafting a reply to Bryson's text, trailed behind, typing as she walked. "Yes, he felt eye discomfort right after getting home. His mother had the driver rush him to the hospital before he could even change. She asked me to stay back and brew herbal remedies for him."

"His mother told you to brew herbal remedies?"Susanna's brow arched, her tone laced with disapproval. "And you agreed? The Hardy family has plenty of servants. Why did she ask you to do these things?"

Seeing Susanna's irritation, Evelina hesitated to admit the truth, waving her hands nervously. "No,Mom.Marissa always handled it before-I wouldn't even know where to start!"

The more Susanna heard, the more something felt amiss. Evelina's voice shrank, and Susanna,shedding her yoga wear, eyed her daughter suspiciously. "Evelina, don't lie to me."

Fearing further probing, Evelina swiftly shifted topics, hiding her blistered middle finger behind her back and stepping forward to help Susanna pick an outfit. "Mom, how could I ever deceive you?"

"Your mother-in-law can be challenging, so stay cautious and keep your focus on Bryson." Susanna chose a dress with intricate vintage patterns,holding it up to the mirror while dispensing advice on winning a man's affection. "You can brew herbal remedies, but pick the right moment. And just make it the way Marissa always does."

Susanna knew people often grow careless when comfortable, and she saw it in Evelina.

"Bryson favors you over Marissa. His eyes are healed now, and women will flock to him. You need to know when to overlook things," Susanna advised.

"Bryson swore he would love only me. I'm the one he truly wants," Evelina replied, her face alight with blissful confidence.

Susanna, seasoned by life's twists, felt a pang of unease at her daughter's words. Bryson was no simpleton-he was sharp and calculating.

Yet, seeing Evelina's radiant happiness, Susanna held back her concerns. She finished dressing and joined her daughter at the vanity, picking out jewelry for their outing.

As Evelina focused on the selection, Susanna asked casually, "Did he say this on the drive home?
Were his parents in the car?"
"His mother was, but his father wasn't. There were business matters-Bryson was meant to join his father, but his dad said that since it's our wedding day, tomorrow would do," Evelina answered,slipping a pair of emerald earrings onto Susanna.The gems gleamed in the mirror, enhancing her elegance.

"Mom, you look stunning!" Evelina leaned against Susanna, a flicker of fatigue in her eyes.

She had been consumed with wedding preparations, juggling gym visits and salon appointments while monitoring Bryson and Marissa,fearing they would reconnect.

"Are you exhausted?" Susanna smoothed Evelina's creased brow, gently massaging as she spoke softly."Do you need a nap? Did Bryson say when he'll pick you up?"

At Bryson's name, Evelina's weariness vanished,her energy renewed. She recalled other tasks awaiting her.

Pulling away from Susanna's embrace, she asked,"Mom,has Marissa ever come back?"

Susanna frowned. The thought of the impostor  who had lived in luxury for years soured her expression. "Why mention her? She's not part of our family anymore. I'll have the servants clear her things and dump them!"

"No, don't!" Evelina blurted, her voice slipping into a coarser tone she usually hid around the Fletcher and Hardy families.

Susanna flinched at Evelina's abrupt outburst,her brow creasing with an unconscious hint of scorn.Masking it with concern, she asked, "Is your throat bothering you?"
###Chapter43 Evelina Is The Only Daughter Of The Fletcher Family
Evelina cleared her throat awkwardly, forcing out a couple of coughs. "I probably caught a chill."  have Becky bring you some medicine,＂Susanna replied. Without hesitation, she grabbed her phone from the vanity. The moment the line connected, she instructed, "Bring up the cold medicine."

When Susanna hung up, Evelina smoothly circled back to the topic she'd been eager to bring up. "I asked one of the servants to brew Bryson's herbal remedies, but she said we're out of the last batch and haven't gotten any more. Mom, did Marissa ever mention where she got herbal medicines from?" Even though Evelina had already married Bryson and no longer saw Marissa as a threat, she still didn't want her returning to the Fletcher family.
Ever since Marissa had taken over Bryson's care,both the Fletcher and Hardy families had come to rely on her completely, treating it like her permanent duty. But with Marissa gone, Evelina panicked when one of the Hardy servants asked her for Bryson's herbal medicines. She almost blurted out something she shouldn't have.

Susanna, who rarely concerned herself with such details, had no clue where Marissa sourced the herbal medicines. She'd never cared enough to ask.

"Becky should know," Susanna said casually."When Marissa was too busy, Becky used to help her with that. You can ask her later."

"Thanks, Mom!" Evelina said cheerfully, planting a quick kiss on Susanna's cheek. "Your skin looks amazing."
"Marissa likely left some of her skincare products behind. Come on, I'll take you to pick a few to use."

Using Marissa's leftover skincare?

Evelina's smile instantly froze. Anger flashed across her face, and she shot Susanna a resentful look.

Keeping her expression stiff, she stayed quiet.
Susanna, however, didn't notice her irritation and kept praising Marissa's products. "I don't know where she got them, but they're even better than  the big brands. They smell herbal and don't cause any allergic reactions. Since you're about her age,what she used should be perfect for you too."

Evelina barely heard a word. Her mind was spinning with doubts.

Had Phil and Susanna ever truly cared about her, or had it all been a lie?

"Mom, don't bother. The skincare products Bryson ordered for me work fine," Evelina said, quickly stopping Susanna before she could open the door to Marissa's room.

Susanna opened her mouth to respond, but Evelina's phone rang, and she answered right away."I'm at my parents' house. Bryson's medicine is finished. No, it's not that I didn't care about him-I've just been busy with the wedding...Hello?"

Before she could finish explaining, Bryson's mother,Jenna Hardy,hung up on her.

"Is that how Jenna usually talks to you?" Susanna asked, her expression turning sour.
The thought that someone would dare speak to her precious daughter rudely filled her with indignation.
"Why didn't you tell me earlier?" she demanded,grabbing Evelina's hand and pulling her toward the stairs. Fury burned in her eyes as she barked,"We're going to the hospital right now! Someone,get the car ready!"

"Mom!" Evelina exclaimed, startled by her mother's outburst. Was Susanna really about to storm into the hospital and face Jenna head-on?

Maybe she had misinterpreted Susanna's earlier actions; it seemed her mother truly cared for her.

Just then, Becky Castro appeared with a cup of water and some cold medicine. "Mrs. Fletcher, the pills are ready."

Susanna stopped in her tracks and turned back."Take your pills first," she said firmly.

Evelina nodded. Once she took the cold medicine,she looked at Becky. "You were the one helping Marissa prepare my husband's medicine, right?"

Becky froze, clearly confused. "Marissa-I'm so sorry, Evelina! You're married?"

The Fletcher family had kept the wedding drama hidden from everyone.

To the outside world, Marissa was still seen as the bride.

Hearing Becky's words, Evelina's eyes burned with anger as her voice rose, rough and shaking with Family rage. "I'm Evelina, not Marissa!" In a fit of rage, she threw the cup straight at Becky.Startled, Becky instinctively tried to dodge, but Evelina shouted sharply, "How dare you move?"
Becky froze, too scared to react. The cup hit its mark, and the remaining water splashed across her face.

Susanna frowned in confusion. "Why are you so upset all of a sudden?"
"Mom, am I not your and Dad's only daughter?"Evelina's voice cracked, her eyes rimmed red as she looked at Susanna like a wounded child.

Susanna's heart twisted. She turned a cold glare on Becky and said firmly, "From now on, remember this. Evelina is the only daughter of the Fletcher family."
Becky, shaken and unsure what she had done wrong, quickly nodded. "Yes,Mrs. Fletcher."
###Chapter44 What Awful Luck


"There, there, Evelina, take a breath and calm yourself," Susanna murmured softly, patting her daughter's back until her crying eased.

Evelina sniffled and wiped her tears, her eyes following Becky as she moved about the room."Mom, does Becky know where Marissa gets that medicine from?"

Without wasting time, Susanna called Becky over.

Becky answered nervously, "Marissa always made the medicine herself. I only helped her with the timing. She never trusted anyone else to handle it.Maybe we can try calling and asking her?"

Between the Hardy and Fletcher families, no one was as involved in Bryson's care as Marissa had been. Mom, we should call Marissa now before she leaves for the countryside," Evelina urged, pushing the phone closer to Susanna. "The place | lived in before was practically falling apart, with no proper signal and barely any internet. Even if she doesn't pick up, we still have to try. Bryson's medicine can't stop!" She couldn't risk her husband losing his sight. Becky's eyes widened as she listened. So Evelina's husband was actually Marissa's fiancé, Bryson?

But how did that happen?

Wasn't today supposed to be Marissa and Bryson's wedding day?

Questions flooded Becky's mind, but there was no one she could ask.

＂門＇ try calling Marissa," Susanna said, taking Evelina to the living room. She motioned to another servant. "Bring the burn ointment."

When the ointment and cotton swabs arrived,Susanna switched her phone to speaker mode and carefully applied the ointment to Evelina's reddened skin.

A robotic female voice came from the phone. "The person you are calling is not available. At the tone,please record your message."

Evelina frowned, glancing suspiciously at the screen. "Do you think she blocked you, Mom?"

"Damn it!" Susanna hissed.
She hung up and tried again, over and over. After several failed attempts, she slammed the used cotton swabs into the trash, her jaw tight with fury. "Ungrateful brat! It's barely been a few hours since Marissa left, and she already dares to ignore me!"

"Mom, I think she's blocked your number," Evelina said grimly.

Her face darkened. Bryson and his mother were waiting for her to bring the medicine, and now there was no way to get it. Panic prickled at the back of her mind.

Susanna shot up from her seat, fuming. "How dare she!"

Evelina almost scoffed.
Why wouldn't Marissa dare?

Susanna stood up too quickly, and a dizzy spell hit her."Oh goodness!"

She stumbled and fell forward, crashing right into Evelina.

Her hand accidentally pressed against Evelina's unhealed burn, making her cry out in pain. "Mom, it hurts! You pressed on my burn!"

Becky glanced over at the scene and sneered,thinking, "That's karma." Then she quietly slipped into the kitchen.
"Mrs. Fletcher, are you alright?" Another servant gasped, hurrying over to help Susanna to her feet.
"Where's your phone?" Susanna demanded the moment she regained her balance.

The servant, Myrna Bowman, unsure what was going on, quickly handed her phone over. "Madam,I swear, I don't use it during work! I only called my kids during my lunch break for a quick video chat,"she said nervously.

"That's not what I meant," Susanna snapped,waving her off. She had Myrna unlock the phone and then tried typing in Marissa's number, but only the first few digits came to mind. She grabbed her own phone to check the complete number and then dialed it on Myrna's phone.

"Hello? Myrna?" Marissa asked cautiously when the line connected.

She had just ended a call with Marc. She answered the new call distractedly, turned a corner, and ran straight into a group of people.

At the front of the group stood Bryson and Jenna,faces she recognized instantly and would've preferred not to see again. Jenna told her son, "Bryson, don't register the marriage with Evelina yet..."

Behind them were several doctors, their white coats swaying as they walked.

"Mr. Hardy," the attending doctor explained, "your vision is improving nicely. There's no need to adjust the prescription yet. Complete this treatmnent cycle and return for a detailed exam."

Beside Bryson stood a man equally striking, tall,composed, and radiating quiet authority. The doctors were a step behind him, feeling overwhelmed by his calm presence.

Bryson's expression darkened the second he spotted Marissa.

Had she followed him all the way here? It seemed she couldn't let go of him.

And he hadn't missed the name she mentioned just now.

Bryson remembered that Myrna was a servant of the Fletcher family. He frowned, his eyes filled with open contempt. The mere sight of Marissa seemed to make him sick tohis stomach.

The attending doctor stopped, confused by why Bryson suddenly stopped in his tracks. When helooked up and saw Marissa, he was stunned by her captivating features.

Jenna had always disliked Marissa. Susanna's endless complaints about her had only deepened that distaste.

So when Jenna saw Marissa here, likely having followed Bryson all the way, her irritation flared.She quickly stepped forward, positioning herself protectively in front of Bryson and snapping, "You _"

Marissa cast a brief, contemptuous glance their way before turning and walking off, continuing her call with Myrna. "Do you need something?"
She thought with a sigh, "What awful luck to run into the Hardies."
###Chapter45 Prank


Ever since Marissa recognized the complete disconnection between herself and Bryson, even a fleeting glimpse of him irritated her profoundly.

The doctor observed Marissa's silhouette fading into the distance, his eyes narrowing subtly behind his spectacles.

Jenna, stunned by Marissa's indifferent attitude,glanced toward where she had departed, then at Bryson. She felt slighted, prompting her to yell sharply, "Bryson! Look at her arrogance! She is not right for you at all. So it's fortunate the Fletchers found their real daughter. With that attitude, she would struggle to find anyone willing to marry her!"

Her voice pierced the air, shrill and cutting,but Bryson's disapproving glance met her outburst,making her realize she had lost her composure.

Flustered, she tried to brush it off, saying, "Sorry,I'm just in a bad mood."

Yet, her face still betrayed her irritation with Marissa, shocked that she had dismissed her so publicly. Jenna knew the truth-that Marissa had been Bryson's caretaker after he lost his sight and hearing-but she deliberately kept it from him.

Therefore, the shift from Marissa's former warmth and deference to her sudden disregard left Jenna deeply unsettled.

The doctors stayed silent, aware that Jenna's claims didn't align with reality, their exchanged glances buzzing with curiosity and whispers of gossip.

One murmured, "I think Mr. Hardy abandoned her."

Another countered, "No, it seems there's more to the story-the woman who just left isn't the Fletchers' real daughter."

Their chatter grew louder until a colleague turned,sternly warning, "Concentrate on your tasks, not irrelevant chatter during work hours."

Instantly,they fell silent.
Jenna,under her breath, muttered, "That bitch is infuriating!" Her face contorted with resentment.

Bryson frowned, wondering whether Marissa had come to see him.

Did Evelina tip her off that he was at the hospital? Somehow, Jenna seemed far more familiar with Marissa than with Evelina, which struck Bryson as odd.

What exactly was happening?
Bryson sensed his family and Evelina were hiding something from him.
Evelina fumbled through their residence as if it were foreign, often relying on servants to locate items.

Marissa, on the other hand, perplexed him even more.

As the adopted daughter of the Fletcher family, she was described by Evelina as a caring sister. Her dramatic outburst at the wedding, claiming to be his fiancée, was shocking.
Even if it meant as a jest, it was excessive.
And Bryson was sure Evelina had been the one attending to him all through his blindness.
Yet, each time he recalled Marissa's disappointed gaze, a pang of loss gripped him, as if something vital was fading with her absence.
Just now, his heart lurched when Marissa appeared, the moment striking him as oddly familiar. Her silent exit left his expression darkening.
He had expected her to storm over, tearfufly demanding answers as she had at the wedding.Instead, she merely glanced at him and departed.

Was she in some kind of trouble, seeking his help?

Recalling Susanna's remarks from the wedding,Bryson summoned his new assistant. "Dunbar."

"Mr. Hardy, what can I do for you?" Dunbar Lewis inquired, hurrying over, anxious not to miss a word from his new employer.

Bryson's eyes gradually drifted from the path Marissa had taken, his voice icy as he instructed,"Start digging into Marissa's background right away. Find out who her birth parents are and what's the deal with the man they set her up with."

Dunbar,caught off guard, frowned in confusion.
Newly assigned to Bryson, he was still uInfamiliar with his boss' personal affairs and the people in his orbit, but he promptly responded, "Understood."

As Bryson trailed the doctors to the office,thoughts of Marissa lingered in his mind.

Bryson found it impossible to ignore Marissa now that she was in distress, especially since he knew she had feelings for him. Marissa had just crossed paths with Bryson at the hospital and plotted a prank against him.

Having ridden in the Hardy family's car countless times, she could recite its license plate from memory.

With no attempt to conceal her actions, she approached the vehicle's tire and knelt beside it.
###Chapter46 Did Theodore Set A Time To Meet You
Marissa had just finished her prank, her tools still in hand,when a sharp car honk startled her.

She looked up.
Wow.It was the latest model of a Rolls-Royce.

Marc had switched cars. This wasn't the one he had driven to the hospital before.

"Rissa, did you drop something?" Marc stepped out of the car and spotted his sister crouching on the ground. Striding over with his long legs, he bent slightly and asked, "What are you looking for?"

He looked ready to help her search.

Marissa, keeping her composure, casually slid her tools under the car and straightened up as if nothing had happened. "I saw two ants fighting just now," she said smoothly. "I got curious, so l watched."
"Really?" Marc chuckled, clearly amused. He had never heard anything like that. Before he could say more, Marissa added calmly, "But you stepped on them, so they both perished in the end

That earned a laugh from Marc. Her deadpan explanation was strangely endearing. He lifted his.foot. "I'm so sorry."

One by one, the siblings climbed into the car.

As soon as the engine started, Marc began explaining why all the brothers had suddenly left the hospital.

Marissa listened quietly, her expression unreadable. Seeing his anxious face-worried she might have taken it the wrong way-made her heart warm slightly, though she barely showed it.

She simply nodded and said she understood.

Marc, as always, was busy. Even in the car,he was juggling work calls and messages. With Rayden's sudden accident, the company's affairs now fell to him,leaving him barely a moment to rest.

Marissa wasn't sitting around either.

Minutes later, her phone buzzed with a message from her subordinate-someone was investigating her.

Her first thought was Bryson.

The message confirmed it. Bryson was indeed  looking into her.

She knew him well. His so-called kindness was just a carefully polished act. The brief encounter was enough to make his thoughts spiral, convincing him she still held a torch for him.

Marissa's brows drew together slightly. Then, as a thought struck her, she straightened abruptly. Was he suspecting something?

"What's wrong?" Marc noticed her sudden movement and paused his work, curiosity flickering across his face.

She had been deep in thought ever since they got into the car, and now her expression kept shifting.Marc's concern grew.

He turned to her and said sincerely, "Rissa, I'm your brother-your family by blood. If anything's bothering you, you need to tell me, okay?"

He knew it wasn't easy for Marissa to open up,let alone to see herself as a true member of the Curtis family. Honestly, even he found it a complicated adjustment.

Marc didn't expect her to pour out her heart immediately.

He only hoped that when problems arose, she  would remember-she wasn't alone anymore.

"No matter what happens, we're all on your side-me,our parents, and our brothers."

Their special concern was reserved for her, their long-lost family.

Marissa was caught off guard by his sudden seriousness. Emotional talks weren't.her thing;she lived by logic, not sentiment.

Still, warmth flickered quietly in her chest. She nodded and said softly, "Thank you, Marc."

Marc reached out instinctively to pat her head but stopped halfway, realizing she was a grown woman now. That kind of gesture might feel childish.

With a quiet sigh-regret for the years they'd missed-he instead gave her a gentle tap on the back of her head. "No need to be so formal with me."

Marissa forced her body to stop avoiding the awkward touch. She had been sitting there calmly at first, but who would have imagined Marc would reach out?

She wanted to punch Marc almost instinctively when his hand came close. Even if he was her brother, she wasn't used to being that close to him. "Did Theodore set a time to meet you?" Marc asked, unaware of the storm brewing beneath her calm demeanor. He took out his phone, intending to exchange contact details with her.
Marissa's attention, however, had shifted to her phone. She had just been added to the family's private group chat,which had eight members.
Before shecould explore it, her phone pinged again and she was added to several huge group chats,each with over three hundred people.
Apparently, it had been a while since they'd welcomed a new member. The excitement was instant.

"Wow, a new member! And Marc invited her!"

"Marc,who is this?"
"Is she your girlfriend,Marc?"
Marissa muted those group chats on WhatsApp.
She hesitated for a moment, then decided not to reply to their questions.

"Why should I meet him?" she asked, her tone casual. Somehow, Marc picked up a subtle edge in her voice-perhaps irritation at the mention of
Theodore.

Knowing how reserved Theodore usually was,he thought for a moment, choosing his words carefully.

"Theodore might look serious, but he's got a good heart," he said. "He's not the talkative type, but he's dependable. Way more reliable than those spoiled rich kids who live off their family wealth."

Only when he tried to compliment someone did Marc realize how few nice things he actually said about other men.

He wasn't used to it, but he gave it his best shot,hoping to make his sister see Theodore in a better light.

"In terms of looks alone," Marc added with a faint grin. "there aren't many in Ozreka who can outshine him."
###Chapter47 | Don't Lend My Things To Strangers
Theodore's features carried a kind of perfection that drew attention effortlessly.

Each time he put on those rimless glasses, he looked even more charming.

Marissa stayed silent, which led Marc to assume she still held some reservations about Theodore.Choosing not to press further, he stopped himself from saying anything more in praise of him.

"You're still young. There's no need to rush things.If you don't feel right about Theodore, we can always call off the engagement."

Marissa's eyes softened as a genuine smile formed on her lips.

She didn't miss the concern in Marc's eyes.

Theodore was everything people claimed he was,and the match appeared ideal.

"Thank you, Marc. I understand," she said quietly,touched by his concern.

She had already compiled a dossier on Theodore,a comprehensive record from his childhood to every woman who had dated him.

Holley's deliberate hint made Marissa curious enough to focus on a certain woman named Betty,prompting her to request a more thorough investigation.

Betty Ellis had grown up alongside Theodore as a childhood companion. Back in their junior high years,she had quietly admired him from afar.

Now that Betty had someone special in her life, her trip home was to introduce himn to her family. That was far from Holley's twisted version, which claimed Betty returned because of Theodore.

Although Marissa didn't believe Holley's words,curiosity still nudged her to look further into the matter.

Her brows knitted as she caught herself falling into her old ways again.

At some point, she had started treating Theodore as someone within her inner circle. Otherwise,there was no reason for her to pry into Betty's history.

Marc was pleasantly surprised by Marissa's composure. With a light smile, he said, "You truly are a good girl." A faint sigh escaped Marissa as helplessness crept in. Was Marc really treating her like some child who needed gentle coaxing?

Marissa suddenly recalled the little girl she and Theodore had encountered in the hospital. She wondered if the child had already reunited with her family.

The girl somehow looked familiar. Marissa pulled up Theodore's number and send him a quick message.

Before long, their car rolled smoothly to a stop at their destination.

"Rissa, we've arrived," Marc said as he stepped out. He moved to her side and opened the door with a light grin. "It'll take some time to get your hair styled, so let's eat first."

Marissa lifted her gaze and noticed the familiar sign of a restaurant she had visited on many occasions.It was one of Evelina's favorites.

As her thoughts drifted to Evelina, Marissa's brows furrowed.

"Don't like this place? Want to head somewhere else instead?" Marc asked with a hint of concern.

Marissa gave a simple shake of her head. "This place will do."

Shortly after the pair crossed the restaurant's entrance, the internet erupted with their photos with various headlines.

"Marc and his mystery girlfriend spotted together for the first time!"

"Wedding bells soon for Marc?"
"Looks like Marc isn't single anymore!"
"Marc was dining with a woman!"

Across countless platforms, rumors began to snowball.

A few even suggested that the woman's outfit looked like a maternity dress, spinning tales that she was using a supposed pregnancy to solidify her place beside him.

The speculation only fueled more curiosity, sending netizens into a frenzy over the woman's identity.

After all, Marc stood among the most admired young elites in Ozreka, a man many women secretly longed for.

A Curtis reveled in the unfolding drama, jumping to the conclusion that Marissa would soon be his wife and immediately broadcasting the news online. "She's joined the Curtis family group chat! Any guesses on her identity? First one to get it right wins ten thousand dollars!"

The post quickly went viral, snowballing in traction and sparking fierce debate among netizens.

Some articles directly painted the woman as Marc's soon-to-be wife.

The frenzy dragged both the Curtis Group and Marc himself into an unwanted spotlight, forcing their PR team to act fast.

Acting without Marc's approval, the team removed all sensational headlines-a quiet, strategic approach. They would issue an official statement at the right time.

Meanwhile, Marissa's schedule had become relentess. Despite her efforts to care for herself,her body began to rebel.

After only a few bites of ice cream, a sharp pain twisted in her stomach. She quickly told Marc she needed a moment and excused herself to the restroom.

Once she stepped out of the stall, Marissa made her way to the sink and turned on the faucet.
Out of nowhere, a voice came from the next sink. "Hi, can I borrow your phone? I think I misplaced mine."

Marissa's eyes shifted briefly toward the speaker.
The woman beside her had a sweet, dolI-like face framed by short bobbed hair, yet Marissa didn't recognize her.

Without saying a word, she turned back to the mirror and continued washing her hands.

"Can I please borrow your phone?" the stranger asked again. Though her lips were curved in a smile, her tone carried a cold sharpness that made her words feel more like a demand.

Marissa immediately picked up on the act. She'd dealt with similar schemes before.

She responded in a flat voice, "No. I don't lend my things to strangers."
###Chapter48 He's Happy To Splash Out On Me
Marissa brushed off the woman's request with a flat refusal.

The woman's face contorted for a split second before she plastered on a sugary smile, tossing her long, curly hair with a sarcastic flourish. "I just want to use your phone to make a call. Why are you being so cold?"

Unfazed by the woman's antics, Marissa reached for the hand dryer, her movements deliberate.

As Marissa made for the exit, the woman sidestepped to block her path, standing tall with a sneer curling her lips. "Why can't you lend me your phone? You're so unhelpful."

"Yup, I'm unhelpful," Marissa shot back, not sparing her a glance. She brushed past, her shoulder grazing the woman's, sending her stumbling to the restroom floor.

"Ow!" the woman cried, clutching her ankle and pretending to be severe pain.

Marc's concerned voice rang out. "Rissa?" The next second, a sharp voice yelled, "Why'd you push Rosie?"

A short woman hurried past Marc and into the restroom,where she knelt to help her friend, Rosie Quimby,up.
Rosie glanced at Marc a few times, resisting her friend's pull.

"Rosie, you've been packing on a few lately? I'm struggling to hoist you up!" her friend teased, brow furrowed as she tugged at Rosie's arm.

Rosie's cheeks burned hotter than a summer sidewalk. She was mortified that her friend had said those words in front of her new crush.

She swatted her friend's hand away, irritation bubbling over. "I haven't gained an ounce. You're just weak as a wet noodle."

Her friend gave another yank, but no dice. She shot a glare at Marissa. "Why are you standing there like a statue? You knocked her down-least you could do is lend a hand!"
Marissa glanced down, lips barely parting, cool as a cucumber. "What, trying to pull a fast one on me?"
"Rissa, are you alright?" Marc hustled over, his eyes locked on Marissa, worry etched on his face He hadn't seen Rosie take her tumble and figured the slick floor by the restroom was the culprit.

"Zip it! You're throwing a wrench in my game plan!"Rosie hissed at her friend.

She then turned to Marc, eyes big as saucers and glistening like she'd just watched a tearjerker. "Sir,could you give me a hand? I think I twisted my ankle," she cooed, voice sweet as honey.

Marissa caught Rosie's shy, hopeful look and wondered if her brother had just won the heart of this starry-eyed woman.

She held her tongue for a beat, wisely staying out of her brother's potential love story, keeping her cool and distant vibe.

Rosie's friend seemed to catch on, shaking her head with a soft mutter that carried to everyone."What's the deal? Since when did you twist your ankle?"

Marc brushed off Rosie and her friend, zeroing in on Marissa. "Youneed a hand, Rissa?"

When Rosie clocked that Marc and Marissa were tight, her shy act vanished faster than ice cream in July. She slumped on the floor, gazing up at Marc with puppy-dog eyes. Rosie's friend clasped her hands, darting to Marissa with a desperate look. "Miss, could your guy help us out? Maybe take Rosie to the hospital?"

Worried Marissa might refuse her request, she piled on the plea. "Please, I'm begging you.Rosie tweaked her ankle in gym class a few days back,and now it's acting up again. We're scared it's gonna get worse!"
"Miss, please..." Rosie sat on the floor, looking.at Marc bitterly, but Marc ignored her. Her eyes never left him, not even when she spoke to Marissa.

"Twisted ankle, huh?" Marc's gaze dropped to Rosie's foot.

Sensing she'd hooked his attention, Rosie flashed a smile sweeter than pie. "Yeah, it's killing me," she pouted.

She flicked her eyes at Marissa, practically daring her with a spark of mischief. So what if Marc was Marissa's man? He was worried about her now.

Marissa rolled her eyes and fixed Rosie with a steady look.

Rosie felt a shiver run down her spine under Marissa's calm but steely gaze, like waking up from a bad dream. But on second glance, Marissa's eyes were cool as a breeze, not a hint of jealousy in sight.
"Miss, your boyfriend's worried about me. You're not green with envy, are you?" Rosie chirped, tilting her head with a cutesy flair. "If you hadn't bumped into me, I wouldn't be dragging him into this."

"Nah," Marissa sneered, unfazed by Rosie's indignant pout. "You've got some serious acting chops. Ever thought about the big screen? I know some top-notch agents if you're game."
Rosie blinked, thrown off by the curveball. "For real?" she blurted.

Marissa leaned in just a touch, flashing a quick smile before pulling it back. "You bet."

Rosie's mind spun like a top. She did dream of being a star.

"That's gotta cost a pretty penny. You getting bankrolled by your boyfriend? You don't strike me as rolling in dough," Rosie probed, her eyes bouncing between them.

"He's happy to splash out on me," Marissa said with a shrug.

"Wow!" Rosie's eyes lit up like Christmas lights."Your guy's loaded and generous. When I'm ready "Wow!" Rosie's eyes lit up like Christmas lights."Your guy's loaded and generous. When I'm ready for a boyfriend, I'm holding out for one just like him -hot, rich, and totally devoted. I'm so jealous!"
###Chapter49 Use Your Charm To Steal My Boyfriend
Marissa shot a glance at Rosie and said, "Well,keep stewing in your jealousy then."

Rosie's face clouded over instantly.
Nearby, Marc gazed at Marissa with affectionate eyes, playing along with her story.

Rosie, feigning innocence, blinked and said, "Miss,what is that supposed to mean? I'm confused. Sir,is your girlfriend throwing shade at me?"

Marc hesitated before responding, "She didn't mean it like that. You're reading too much into it."
Rosie batted her lashes and cooed, "Miss, I'm honestly jealous of you two. I've always been under my family's thumb. I've never even had a boyfriend."

A sharp giggle erupted nearby.
Rosie knew exactly who it was and fired a fierce glare at her friend, silently demanding silence.
Thefriend stifled her laughter, stepping back a few paces. "I see..." Marissa nodded as if absorbing Rosie's words, a sly smirk tugging at her lips. Nonchalantly,she added, "Then step up your game. Use your charm to steal my boyfriend."
Her casual tone left Rosie speechless, her eyes darting to her friend in shared confusion.
What did this woman mean by that?

"Doesn't that bother you?" Rosie pressed, lips tight, feeling off-balance. She thrived on the thrill of taking other people's boyfriends, but...

Her skeptical gaze lingered on Marissa's face. This woman seemed too straight-laced for love games-had she misjudged her?
Marissa even looked oddly familiar, though Rosie couldn't place her.

"Why would it bother me?" Marissa countered,arching an eyebrow.

Rosie faltered, at a loss for words.

Her friend jumped in, "Come on, Rosie, let's drop the joking. Your ankle's looking swollen!" Then she turned to Marc and approached him, putting on a coquettish smile. "Sir, could you help get Rosie to a hospital?"

Rosie scoffed, annoyed. "What are you doing?" Was her friend trying to compete with her for this handsome man's attention?

Her friend wore a sly expression as she brushed off Rosie's irritation and whispered, "You don't think you've already claimed him, do you? What's wrong with me trying to?"
Each word deepened Rosie's scowl, leaving her speechless.
"The food is all set. Do you want to keep up the act?" Marc asked Marissa, who seemed tired.

Marissa shook her head, stifling a yawn. "No more games. I'm starving-let's eat."

The siblings turned to walk away, leaving Rosie and her friend behind.

Rosie let out a scornful huff, her eyes stabbing into Marissa's back, her voice sharp. "So you're just going to leave like that?"

Marissa stopped, turning with a sly half-smile."Anything else?" she asked.

Rosie shed her facade, rising from the floor. "You think you can just shove me and walk off? I could have you both kicked out of here!"

It sounded like she owned this place. Marissa hadn't heard of any new management.
"Go ahead," Marissa said, narrowing her eyes as she sized Rosie up, her long false lashes hiding the glint in her gaze.

"You!" Rosie fumed, despising Marissa's dismissive stare, her teeth clenched. "I will teach you a hard lesson!"

"I doubt it," Marissa replied coolly.
Rosie's face burned with rage.
Was this woman mocking her?
"Sir, need a new girlfriend? You should consider me." Rosie's friend flipped her hair, her calculated gestures drawing attention to her chest.
Marc shot a frosty glance at Rosie and her friend and didn't bother saying another word to tem.

"Let's go," he said, slipping an arm around Marissa as they walked off. "Rissa, there's no point wasting time on people like these."

"Marc, you don't like them?" Marissa teased.
She thought some sharp guys went for shallow women.
Rosie, watching them leave, yanked out her phone in a fury and called her boyfriend. "You at work?" Her friend leaned against the wall, her mood just as sour.

Marissa and Marc returned to their private dining room, where their ordered dishes awaited. The waiter greeted them warmly. "Ring the bell if you need anything."

Then he stepped out to stand by.
The siblings settled into their seats, and quietly dug into their meal.
Meanwhile, Rosie finished ranting over the phone,eating with her friend while waiting for her boyfriend.

He was the restaurant manager and arrived promptly after the call. Rosie spun an exaggerated version of what had just happened.
###Chapter50 Jealousy


Rosie vented her frustration to her boyfriend."Darling, those two went too far. They.."
In her story, Marc became the sleazy man who couldn't control himself around her, while Marissa was the accomplice helping him.
Rosie tearfully insisted that if her friend hadn't walked into the restroom when she did, she might have been sexually assaulted by that monster.
Her boyfriend Bernie Alvarez, dressed neatly in a fitted suit, looked refined. After hearing Rosie's story, he was furious. He smashed several cups and said sharply, "Don't worry, sweetheart. I'll find them and make sure they're kicked out. They'll never set foot here again!"

"Thank you!" Rosie said, quickly leaning forward to kiss him. The two shared a long, public kiss and even had sex right there.

Rosie's friend continued eating, unaffected.

After a few minutes, the sex was over. Rosie exhaled and leaned back in her chair, looking tired.Bernie straightened his suit and left, appearing satisfied. Once outside, he questioned the waiters, his tone harsh. "Were you even doing your jobs? A customer was almost assaulted in the restroom,and none of you saw a thing? Showv me the surveillance footage!"
The waiters, busy serving other customers, looked at him blankly.

"Customers go to the restroom all the time after eating," one said. "How are we supposed to find them now? They've probably left."

"Exactly," another added. "We can't access the footage without the boss's permission."

Their tone made it clear that Bernie didn't have the authority to demand anything.

Frowning, he said, "You all know Rosie is my girlfriend. How could you let her be bullied?"

So it was his girlfriend who had almost been assaulted.

A young waitress rolled her eyes.
Before she could respond, the head waiter pulled her aside and said, "Mr. Alvarez, with all respect,you change girlfriends too often. Even if we want to help, we need to know who it is this time."

"You-!" Bernie slammed the counter. "Haven't you all met Rosie?"

The head waiter feigned a confused expression."Didn't you say last time that Rosie was just your friend?"

"I'm done talking with you," Bernie snapped."Just remember this: today's accident is a direct result of your neglect. Therefore, you'll pay Rosie's bill to make it upo to her."

He then turned and walked off.
After he left, a waiter muttered under his breath."He's really a bastard, acting all high and mighty."

"Don't take what he said to heart. Let's just get back to work," the head waiter said, noting the incident down for his end-of-month report.

Marissa didn't care about Rosie's earlier threats.After eating, she and Marc went downstairs, only to see Rosie in the lobby.

Rosie was clinging to a man in a suit, smiling and flirting. The man occasionally kissed her as if no one was watching.

Spotting Marissa, Rosie paused for a moment. Her expression darkened, and she immediately stepped away from Bernie. Confused by her sudden change in attitude, he tried to pull her back by the waist, but she pushed him off.
Bernie was irritated at being rejected in front of others. His face hardened as he asked, "What's wrong with you now,Rosie?"
Paying no mind to his words, Rosie remained completely captivated by Marc. Whenever he was around,Bernie meant nothing to her.
"Are you yelling at me?" Rosie demanded, planting her hands on her hips as she glared at Bernie."First you lie to me, and now you yell at me? We're done!"

She had thought Bernie had actually forced Marc and Marissa to leave. Realizing he had lied and was now scolding her in public made her furious.

Why did she need him at all?
He didn't even satisfy her.

Bernie, stunned by the sudden breakup, followed her gaze and saw Marc and Marissa nearby.

He didn't pay much attention to Marc-many men there dressed in designer clothes, and appearances meant little.
But his eyes lingered on Marissa for a few seconds.Rosie noticed immediately, and her expression turned cold.
She quickly softened her tone and said, "Honey..."
Bernie's attention returned to her at once. He put his arm around her waist again and asked, "You're jealous just because I looked at someone else?"
Rosie gave a faint, embarrassed smile.

Marissa ignored both of them completely and walked out without looking back.

Rosie's face darkened. She leaned toward Bernie and whispered something in his ear, then followed Marissa outside.

As she walked through the corridor lined with glass cabinets displaying fine porcelain, she suddenly lunged forward toward a waitress.
The waitress lost balance and bumped into Marissa.

With a sharp crash, one of the glass cabinets toppled over.
###Chapter51 Are You Just Feeling Guilty

One by one, the plates from the display case tumbled out, striking the floor and breaking apart with sharp, ringing cracks.
Evening service was in full swing, and the restaurant buzzed with lively conversation and clinking cutlery.

The sudden crash at the entrance drew every eye toward the noise.

Marissa quickly regained her balance and reached out to steady the waitress who had nearly stumbled onto the scattered shards. The waitress looked shaken, her face drained of color. "Thank you!"
For a moment, silence hung thick in the air before hushed whispers began spreading across the room.

"What was that sound?"
"Someone must've hit the display cabinet. The plates inside are all smashed. Whoever did this will have to compensate a lot since they're valuable."

"And how do you know they are valuable?" "Those plates are antiques worth around ten million. This...is serious." "You're making that up! Who would display something worth ten million right in the cabinet?That makes no sense."

"Who knows? Maybe the owner wants to showcase the craftsmanship of those plates."

Although Bernie was supposed to be on vacation,his presence automatically put him in charge of the situation.

He stepped in front of Rosie protectively, his eyes narrowing as he surveyed the fragments scattered across the floor. His tone turned sharp as he said to the trembling waitress, "Be more careful next time! Incidents like this will go straight into your evaluation! And you'll have to compensate for the loss."

Inside the case had been a mix of authentic antiques and high-quality replicas, each with varying degrees of worth.

Every staff member had been trained to know exactly which items were off-limits.

Among the shattered remains lay one genuine antique that the restaurant owner had displayed purely to enhance the establishment's prestige. That single plate alone carried a price tag of over a million.

The realization hit the waitress hard, draining the color from her cheeks until she looked ready to faint right there before Bernie.
Marissa reached out just in time, steadying the young woman before she could stumble.

Broken porcelain and glass fragments covered the floor, sharp enough to slice through skin. With their knee-length skirts offering little protection, a fall would have been disastrous.

From behind Bernie, Rosie peeked out, her hand pressed lightly against her lips. "What on earth happened here?"

Her gaze flicked to the waitress, eyes glittering with thinly veiled malice. "Did you knock it over?"

The poor woman flinched like a frightened sparrow,shaking her head in panic. "N-no, it wasn't me!"

"Then who did it?" Rosie's tone carried a chilling sweetness that only made the question sound more accusatory. "Did anyone see?"

"It is the lady in the gray suit," someone finally said,gesturing toward Marissa.
At that, Rosie's lips curved ever so slightly, herdelight barely hidden behind an expression of mock concern. "Oh, so it was you, Miss? You really should be more careful."

"It wasn't her, I swear!" the waitress said, her voice trembling but firm. She knew exactly what kind of person Rosie was and rushed to defend Marissa."Someone bumped into me, and I accidentally hit this-"

Her sentence faltered halfway when she noticed that only Rosie and Bernie were standing nearby.

Where had that person gone?
Color drained from her face as every pair of eyes in the room turned toward her. "I'm telling the truth!Someone really bumped into me! If you don't believe me, we can look at the security footage!"

At the mention of the cameras, Rosie's expression tightened. She gave Bernie a discreet pinch, her smile faltering.

"There's no need to dig that deep over something so trivial. It's just a few broken plates. Just settle it and move on." "I heard one of those plates was an antique." "Come on, I've been coming here for years, and never once heard about antique dishes being displayed," another diner muttered under their breath.

"Why not just review the footage? That'll clear everything upo," a voice from the back added,sounding calm and reasonable.

Rosie's eyes darted toward the direction of the voice, irritation flashing across her face at the unwanted comment.

The crowd was dense, though, and it was impossible to pinpoint who had spoken up.

"Cat got your tongue, Miss? Or are you just feeling guilty?" Rosie taunted, twirling a strand of hair between her fingers. "You can't afford the damages and think pretending not to hear will save you,huh?"

To Rosie, Marissa's outfit screamed imitation. Her contempt intensified.

Then her gaze shifted toward Marc, who stood quietly beside Marissa, and a flicker of envy stirred behind her smile.

In her mind, a man like him should belong to her.

"So this is your type, sir? No wonder you're not interested in me. You prefer deceitful women,I suppose," Rosie said, her tone dripping with false
sweetness.
Marc remained still beside Marissa, offering no response.

During the brief time he had spent with his sister,he had come to notice something peculiar-Marissa seemed to find amusement in watching others make fools of themselves.

"Check the surveillance footage," Marissa replied coldly, her tone sharp and unwavering as her gaze locked on Rosie.

In her mind, the scene unfolding before them was no coincidence. Rosie had clearly staged this entire mess just to draw Marc's attention.

As Marissa looked at Rosie, she noticed a hickey on her neck-one that hadn't been there during their previous encounter. Her eyes then shifted to Bernie, landing on the lipstick mark on his collar.
Did they just share intimate moments somewhere in this restaurant?
###Chapter52 You Want Me To Pay By Card Or Cash

Marissa sized up Bernie with a clinical eye, barely noticing the chaos around her.
Bernie caught her staring and figured she was interested in him. It set his heart racing like a jackrabbit.
He jutted his chin at her, flaunting what he thought was a killer jawline.

"Bernie!" Rosie hissed, pinching his side with all her might, her voice sharp as a tack.
"Ow, damn it!" Bernie winced and shot her a scowl."You've lost your mind or what?" he snapped, his annoyance with Rosie growing.

Rosie wasn't blind to his sudden attitude shift. He was losing interest in her and had fallen for another woman.

Rosie bit down hard, her jaw tight, then forced a sweet, submissive smile. Her hand slid along Bernie's side, suggestive and sly, as she leaned in and purred, "Honey..."

She knew she still had to wrap him around her finger since she had not yet won the heart of the man she had a crush on.

Bernie's mind flicked back to their steamy moments together, a smirk tugging at his lips.

He shot Marissa a sour look, his tone dripping with contempt. "Who do you think you are, strutting in here demanding to see the security tapes?Someone saw you crash into that display case.You really gonna play dumb?"

"Two peas in a pod," Marissa thought,letting out a sneer.

No wonder Bernie and Rosie were drawn to each other like magnets.

"Miss, you got the cash to cover this?" Rosie asked, her pretty face all doe-eyed concern as she tugged at Bernie's sleeve, faking a plea for Marissa."Bernie, maybe we could..."

"No need to make a fuss," Marissa cut in, brushing off Rosie's crocodile tears.

Rosie's face fell, her mind racing. Had she pegged this woman wrong? Did this woman actually have the money to cover the loss?

Rosie's teeth ground together, her frustration bubbling und er the surface. "I doubt she has the money," a bystander muttered.
"See that jacket she's rocking? If it's legit, a million bucks is chump change for her," another whispered.

"That guy next to her-sugar daddy vibes.He looks familiar. I've seen him somewhere," someone else chimed in.

"That waitress knows her or something? She's trying to help, but this lady's not having it."
"With a sugar daddy, who's sweating a few grand?"

The crowd murmured among themselves, each tossing in their hot take.

Bernie's eyes scanned Marissa's face, lingering a bit too long before he scoffed, "Show some respect, and I might cut you a deal-just the original price, no extra fees."

Extra fees? Marissa's brow twitched.

"Mr. Alvarez, it wasn't her!" the waitress blurted,finally steadying her nerves, sticking up for Marissa and herself. "Someone else bumped into us!"
She wasn't about to take the fall for nothing.

"Zip it!" Bernie snapped, his glare sharp enough to cut glass. "I'll deal with you later." "I..." The waitress opened her mouth to retort, but a sharp signal from the head waiter made her snap it shut.

Her eyes tracked his retreating figure, wondering if he was off to fetch someone superior.
Rosie,meanwhile,wvas frustrated with Bernie.
Why was he offering Marissa not to pay the extra fees?

"You want me to pay by card or cash?" Marissa asked coolly, her gaze darting to another display case. She recalled a plate there that matched the broken one-a perfect set.
She wanted it broken.
Marc was stumped by Marissa's game plan. Still,he did not interfere, ready to step in if her first play failed.

Bernie hadn't expected Marissa to agree to compensate. His face twisted, and he barked at someone to grab the card machine, muttering,"Better hope your card's got enough in it."

Marissa hadn't swung by the Fletcher family villa,so all she had was her phone-no card in sight.
Marc reached for his wallet, ready to whip out his bank card. "Clear the way!" a voice boomed.
A man came rushing over, clearly in a hurry. His round face was flushed, and he was panting so hard that everyone could practically hear his lungs protesting.
Not far off, the head waiter caught the waitress's eye and made a quick hand signal-it meant he'd brought someone important.

The waitress followed his gaze and froze for a moment before her eyes lit up. Jaxton Clarke,the general manager,was here.

He had a reputation for being fair and just-a man who never played favorites.

Bernie also spotted him immediately.
"Mr. Clarke! What are you doing here?" Bernie's expression flipped faster than a coin-gone was his earlier arrogance, replaced with a syrupy smile.

Jaxton wasn't working today, so what brouight him here?

Had someone notified him?

Bernie's eyes darted around the room, scanning every face. One of them must've ratted him out.
If he'd known this would happen, he'd have stayed  far away.

It was Rosie's fault.
And then his sharp gaze landed on her.

Rosie caught his glare and felt her temper flare.What was that supposed to mean? Was he really trying to pin this on her?

What a pathetic man! When things went wrong,he pointed the finger at a woman.
"What's that smell on you?" Jaxton waved Bernie away,telling him to stay away.
Jaxton's gesture made Bernie's expression sour.Feeling uneasy, he scented himself. "I don't smell anything out of the ordinary."
###Chapter53 The Big Boss

Jaxton explained, "I have rhinitis. Certain perfumes trigger my allergies."

"Ah, that makes sense," Bernie replied, relief washing over his face.

Knowing Jaxton's close ties with the three bosses,Bernie grew anxious about any potential backlash.In a rush to defend himself, he pointed toward Marissa and said, "This customer has already agreed to cover the damages."

The shattered porcelain scattered across the floor made the incident impossible to deny.

Without bothering to look at him, Jaxton mnotioned for silence with a slight wave of his hand.

Then he walked straight to Marc, offering a polite smile and a respectful tone. "Mr. Curtis, please accept my apologies. Our staff clearly weren't trained well enough. I take full responsibility and hope you'll overlook this mistake."

Confusion clouded the room after Jaxton spoke,and one by one, everyone's eyes landed on Marc,drawn by the quiet allure of his refined features. That face... It was almost unreal in its perfection.
Shock flickered in Rosie's expression. Could the man who had made her pulse race actually be one of the bosses?

Instinctively, she took a few steps back, afraid Marc might misread her closeness with Bernie. Bending toward her friend, she whispered, "Miriam, how dol look? Is anything off?"

Miriam Hussain's eyes flicked toward Rosie but stayed quiet, her gaze eventually settling on Marc with a spark of recognition.

It turned out that man belonged to the Curtis family.
A glimmer of intent brightened Miriam's gaze. She had made up her mind-Marc would be hers.

"Mr. Curtis, are you all right?" Jaxton asked, his tone laced with genuine concern as he studied Marc's expression, fearful the man might hold them responsible.

Everyone in Ozreka knew the Curtis family's reach could topple businesses with a single word.

In truth, only the elusive big boss had the authority to face them without flinching.

However, that figure was rarely seen. Aside from a fleeting encounter in a virtual meeting three years ago, Jaxton could barely remember the big boss's face-only that it was a strikingly young woman.

Marc was perfectly fine.
He had been a step behind Marissa when it all happened, spared from being caught in the chaos,and hadn't even found a moment to stepo in.
However, Marissa had already regained her balance and even caught the waitress before she could fall.

Quietly, Marc said nothing, his expression unreadable.

Jaxton studied Marc's expression with growing unease, uncertain what that heavy silence truly implied.

Nervousness prickled at the back of his neck as he dabbed at the sweat forming on his forehead,wondering if it was wiser to call one of the higher-ups for guidance. Dealing with anyone from the Curtis family always left him on edge.Just then, his eyes drifted toward the woman standing beside Marc, and understanding dawned on him like a sudden jolt. He nearly smacked his own forehead for missing something so obvious-men, especially when a woman was present, cared deeply about saving face.

That realization shifted his demeanor at once. His back straightened, his tone softened, and he chose his words with delicate care. "Mr. Curtis, I hope the young lady with you wasn't hurt in the commotion..."

As Jaxton spoke, his gaze flicked briefly toward the woman in question.

But the sight caught him off guard. His polite smile faltered halfway through his sentence.

Her makeup looked far too heavy for someone her age-mascara clumped thick on her lashes, eye shadow smudged unevenly, and her lips bare of color. However, despite the mess, her beauty still demanded attention.

A teasing spark lingered in her eyes, the kind that stirred an odd sense of familiarity within him.

Then it hit him-she bore an uncanny resemblance to his big boss.

What in the world was going on?
Could this possibly be her? For a moment, Jaxton's thoughts scattered like marbles. His gaze locked on the young woman.
Even beneath that clumsy makeup, the resemblance was undeniable. Every subtle twitch of her lips, every glint in her eyes, mirrored his big boss perfectly.

Good heavens... what was she doing here?
Completely thrown off, Jaxton gawked at Marissa,lips parting slightly but unable to form a single word.

Maybe he was seeing things.

Blinking hard, he shut his eyes for a second before daring another look-and there it was, that same familiar face staring back at him.

Slowly, his gaze swept over Marissa's features, her faintly teasing smile making his pulse quicken with uncertainty. Was this really his big boss standing before him?

Forcing down his shock, Jaxton straightened and spoke in a more respectful tone than he'd used with Marc earlier. "Miss, I must apologize on behalf of our restaurant. Please forgive us."
After a pause, his voice turned careful."May.I know your name?" "Marissa."
The moment the word left her lips, Jaxton's eyes flew wide

It was her-the big boss herself!
###Chapter54 Apologize To Our Big Boss Now
Marissa stood a short distance from Jaxton. Her eyes flicked past Marc, settling softly on him.
After discovering Marissa's true identity,Jaxton felt the weight of her gaze, heavy and oppressive, as if it pinned him down, leaving him breathless and unable to resist.

Panic surged.
Did the big boss see him as incompetent,incapable of handling even a minor issue?

No, he couldn't let the big boss think so poorly of him.

Jaxton resolved to deal with Bernie decisively,no more leniency.

"Step aside," he said, nudging the colleague between him and Marissa, then approaching her with a respectful attitude.

"Boss, I checked into the matter on my way here.It's all a misunderstanding! Rest assured, I'll crack down on them to ensure this doesn't happen again!" Boss?
Marc's expression turned pensive, glancing at his newly reunited sister.
Marissa met his look unflinchingly.
Their eyes locked briefly, but they said nothing to each other.
Jaxton had only heard a quick summary from the head waiter and didn't know the full story.

He had hurried over because the head waiter said Bernie had clashed with Marc, all because Bernie's girlfriend claimed she had nearly been assaulted.

Bernie, defending his new fling, had lashed out at Marc and his companion.

Bernie was a recent hire at the restaurant through connections.

No one would have thought he would cause such a huge mess, crossing the Curtis family and the big boss.

Jaxton's face flushed with anger.
What was Bernie thinking, picking a fight with the wrong people? It was so reckless.

Breaking an antique plate by accidentally bumping into a display case? Even if it was intentional,so what?
The restaurant was Marissa's-she could do as she pleased.

"You, get over here!" Jaxton beckoned Bernie sharply.

Bernie pointed at himself, stunned. "Me?"

"What are you waiting for? Apologize to our big boss now!" Jaxton's expression darkened.

What? Big boss?
Bernie was stunned.

Onlookers who hadn't planned to linger found themselves glued to the scene, some pulling out phones to record.

Bernie, burning with resentment, approached Marissa, bewildered. How was this woman the big boss?

Marissa just smiled, silent.Seeing him tongue-tied, Jaxton clapped a heavy hand on his shoulder. "Why are you standing there mute?""L." Bernie, feeling awkward, couldn't speak, his face red, avoiding Marissa's gaze. "Boss, I promise, we'll make sure this never happens again!" Jaxton said, covering for Bernie's silence.

"I..." Bernie attempted to speak again, but the words were stuck in his throat.
Jaxton continued, "Boss, it's my fault for not managing things properly, letting you and Mr.Curtis get caught in a misunderstanding..."
"I'm sorry!" Bernie shouted, cutting Jaxton off.

Jaxton's anger boiled over.

Bernie had frozen when it was his turn to speak,and now, as Jaxton tried to smooth things over,he was causing more trouble.

"Why are you yelling?" Jaxton snapped, glaring at Bernie, his frustration spiking. "Show some respect, or you're done here!"

Bernie bit back his protests under Jaxton's glare and muttered another apology. "I'm sorry, boss.I misjudged you and didn't know who you were."

Jaxton caught the snide edge in Bernie's tone and,glancing at Marissa's expression, kicked him sharply."Apologize properly!"

Who did Bernie think he was fooling with that attitude? Jaxton could barely resist rolling his eyes at the chaos Bernie had caused.

Bernie took a deep breath, forced a weak smile,and bowed his head, utterly deflated. "Boss, I'm so sorry."

Rosie's face twisted with dismay.

She hadn't anticipated that the woman she had targeted was the top boss of the restaurant,Culinary Oasis.

This wasn't just a local chain in Ozreka-it was a global powerhouse, a name known wherever people dined.

Marissa, with her low-key appearance, was the big boss?

It was hard to believe.
Some onlookers who had been recording slipped their phones away, also taken aback by the revelation of Marissa's identity.

Culinary Oasis was run by three key figures.

One of them was a familiar face, coming from a family entrenched in the global food and hospitality scene.

The other two figures, however, were seldom seen in public.
Who could have guessed the big boss would show up so unassumingly?
###Chapter55 Pack Up Your Things And Leave
Rosie's face darkened, her hands curling into tight fists at her sides as anger burned through her veins.That bitch!

Why had Marissa pretended to be poor in front of her when she was clearly wealthy?
Rosie was fuming inside.

Marissa, hands tucked casually in her pockets,seemed oblivious to the silent fury directed at her.She smiled faintly at Jaxton, waiting to see how he'd handle things.

"Boss, what brings you here today?" Jaxton asked carefully.

He assumed Marissa wouldn't make a scene.Culinary Oasis was a joint venture owned by three people, and she was one of them.

Surely,she wouldn't want to escalate things further  and risk damaging the company's image and profits.

Otherwise, why had she kept her identity quiet for so long? She must have wished to lessen the effect.
Jaxton convinced himself she was just trying to avoid unnecessary drama-just like him.

"Boss?" He tried again when Marissa didn't respond right away. Her silence made him uneasy.He couldn't believe she'd shown up just for ameal.
Marissa's eyes flickered with disappointment.
She had thought Jaxton was different from Bernie.
But clearly, she'd been wrong.
With a faint smile that didn't reach her eyes, she asked calmly, "That's all?"

"Huh?" Jaxton blinked. "Yes, boss. It's all taken care of."

What else was there to handle?

Though Bernie had offended the wrong people, any punishment would be handled privately.

Wasn't that the right approach?

Marissa's smile faded. She stared at Jaxton, her expression unreadable.

Jaxton frowned, unsure what to make of the look she gave him.

A few feet away, the head waiter gave a discreet signal to the waitress. The young woman hesitated,then gathered her courage and walked toward Marissa.

"Boss, I.." she stammered, her voice trembling.Standing in front of Marissa now, she looked nothing like the confident employee from earlier.
Marissa met her eyes calmly. "No need to be nervous," she said gently.

Her tone was steady-unchanged despite her authority. The reassurance helped; the waiter took a quiet breath to steady herself.
"I... I think the person who bumped into me was a friend of Mr. Alvarez," she finally managed to say.
Marissa, crouched down as she picked up the shards of a broken antique plate, looked up briefly and gave a small, amused chuckle. "Do you have proof?"

The waitress faltered, eyes darting downward.After a moment's hesitation, she bit her lip and said, "The head waiter must have seen it. And the cameras probably caughtit too."

Marissa examined two ceramic pieces, fitting them together absently. "Are you and Bernie on bad terms?" she asked in an even tone. "Has he bullied you before?" Marc, standing nearby, didn't care for antiques and couldn't tell if the plate was valuable or not-but at that question, his gaze flickered.
For a few seconds, the waitress remained silent.

Marissa didn't press. She placed the fragments aside and spoke casually, though her words carried weight. "So, do you think we shouldn't keep employees like him here? Should I fire him?"

The waitress shook her head quickly, panic flashing across her face. Everyone knew Bernie was related to one of the bosses.

Complaining about him was a dangerous move.

The big boss wouldn't always be around to protect her. And if, later, Bernie was spared, she'd be the one to suffer.

The courage she had mustered drained away as quickly as it came.

Marissa turned slightly. "What do you think,Jaxton?"

Jaxton stood beside Marissa and the waitress,having heard every word of their exchange.

He shot Marissa a brief glance, sensing what she was getting at-but hesitation clouded his face. "Boss,"
he began carefully, lowering his voice. "Bernie has been placed here at the instruction of another boss's secretary."
It wasn't that Jaxton didn't want to deal with Bernie -it was that he couldn't.

Disciplining someone connected to upper management was risky.
One wrong move, and he could find himself fired.

Marissa straightened, taking the handkerchief Marc offered. She wiped her hands slowly, her tone calm but pointed. "So, Jaxton, you've known about him bullying others for some time?"
Pausing for a moment, Jaxton turned to face Bernie, who was standing there in silence, and abruptly shouted, "You don't need to come to work tomorrow,Bernie!"

Bernie snapped out of his daze, glaring at Jaxton with open hostility. "Who do you think you are,Jaxton? You can't just fire me!" he barked.
Jaxton's jaw tightened. He cast a quick glance at Marissa, who stood with her hands in her pockets,her expression calm but laced with impatience. He frowned, his voice cutting through the tension. "Do I really need to list your misconduct here, in front of everyone? Having someone like you on staff is a disgrace. Pack up your things and leave!"

Then, turning slightly toward Marissa, Jaxton added with forced composure, "Don't worry, boss.I'll handle the situation tonight. We'll begin retraining immediately, and the next time you visit,you'll see a team that meets your expectations."
Bernie listened to Jaxton's assurances and sneered.

"You're really something, Jaxton!" Bernie spat,raising a trembling finger at him, so angry he could barely keep his balance.
###Chapter56 A Gift From Theodore

Jaxton shot Bernie a subtle glance, signaling him to play along for now, but Bernie, consumed by fury,completely missed the cue.
Marissa smiled at the pair, singling out Jaxton with a nod of approval. "You're quite sharp, always looking out for the restaurant's interests, aren't you,Jaxton?"
Bernie rolled his eyes, tempted to lash out, but Marissa's soft gaze held a pressure that made defying Jaxton's orders feel impossible.

He mulled it over.
Before Jaxton arrived, he believed he hadn't said anything offensive to upset Marissa-just parroting a few of his girlfriend's complaints.

But he was just trying to seek justice for his girlfriend. Who could have predicted this outcome?

"So why are you still standing there? Go and deal with them," Marissa said, her voice slicing through the tension as she let out a sudden chuckle. "Going forward, I don't want Bernie and Jaxton setting foot in any Culinary Oasis location. Can you make that happen?" Her eyes shifted to the head waiter.
Glancing at the stunned Jaxton and Bernie, he replied firmly, "Yes, boss, I'll take care of it."
"Go on," Marissa said with a wave, her tone sharpening with a dangerous edge. "This restaurant does not tolerate abuse of power.I expect you to ensure this doesn't happen again."
The head waiter's piercing stare landed on Bernie."Did you hear that, Bernie? If you did, then hurry up and get out!"

Backed by Marissa's authority, the head waiter spoke quietly to avoid tarnishing Culinary Oasis'reputation, ensuring only those nearby could hear.
"Boss, I don't understand what's wrong with my actions!" Bernie protested.

Marissa ignored his whining, giving the head waiter a pointed look.

The head waiter's face turned stern as he snapped,"Do you really see nothing wrong with your actions? You and your girlfriend were openly bullying people."

Bolstered by Marissa's support, he radiated authority. "Weren't you the one stirring up trouble for Mr. Curtis just to defend your girlfriend?""Rosie said there was a man who nearly assaulted her. How could Mr. Curtis be that kind of person?"Bernie shot back, his glare venomous as he stared down the head waiter.
Desperate to avoid looking bad in front of Marc,Rosie jumped in, "I was telling Bernie about an old incident. It's just a mix-up. Why can't you let it go?"
Rosie's attempt to diffuse the tension backfired,only confirming Bernie's actions.

"I'm leaving this to you," Marissa said, dismissing their words and directing the head waiter before motioning for Marc to follow her out.
The head waiter nodded confidently. "Don't worry,I'll handle it."
"Boss, hold on!" Jaxton called out, ignoring the chaos as he chased after Marissa, shocked that she wanted to sack him to0.

The head waiter grabbed his arm. "You had better start packing too."

Unlike Bernie, who had landed his job through connections, Jaxton had earned his position fairly and squarely.
Watching Marissa leave, he sighed, then turned to scold the head waiter. "Why didn't you tell me the big boss was here when you called? You let me walk into that blind!"

The head waiter, who had only learned Marissa's identity just now, retorted, "Stop the complaints.You have heard the boss' order. You are fired. Your duties are mine now."
With that, he summoned the security team he had brought and barked, "Get them out!"

Rosie, about to leave with Miriam, bristled at the order and opened her mouth to protest, but a stone-faced guard silenced her, covering her mouth and hauling her off.
Soon, aside from Miriam, who stayed quiet, Bernie and Jaxton were also escorted out.

At Culinary Oasis's entrance, two men in suits stood on either side as Marissa stepped out.

"Hello, Miss Curtis," said one.

"Miss," said the other.
Noting their differing addresses, Marissa asked,"What is this about?"

The man on the left smiled. "I'm Mr. Brooks'assistant."

The man on the right shot him a glance before introducing himself. "I'm Mr. Marc Curtis'assistant."

Marissa gave a slight nod, urging Theodore's assistant to go on.
He pulled documents from his briefcase. "These are a gift from Mr. Brooks for you."
Marissa paused, wondering what Theodore was up to.

Marc's assistant saw the documents and produced his own, handing them over. "Miss Curtis, your brother asked me to give you these."
###Chapter57 Share Transfer Forms

Marc's assistant handed the documents to Marissa, hoping she would accept them rather than Theodore's assistant's.

Marissa lifted a brow, curious about what was going on.

But before she could speak, Theodore's assistant made his own move. He stepped forward with a polished smile and presented his documents openly. "Miss Curtis."

Marc's assistant felt his eye twitch.
Seriously?
That man had the nerve to use that kind of smile just to hand something over? Was he trying to flirt his way through this?

Marc's assistant shot him a discreet glare, debating whether to involve his boss, only to spot Marc himself approaching, walking with that unmistakable confidence.

Marc stopped beside Marissa, his sharp eyes instantly taking in the scene.

Aside from his own assistant, Theodore's assistant was there. The man was composed, distant, and had the same cool demeanor his boss was known for.

"Theodore sent you?" Marc asked, adjusting his cufflinks with an easy grace. His eyes dropped briefly to the documents the man held, one brow arching in mild amusement. Theodore certainly knew how to play his cards-clever, deliberate, and clearly aiming to impress Marissa.
Marc's assistant, reading his boss's expression,stepped closer and murmured quietly, "Mr. Curtis,he was already here when I arrived."

He wasn't sure exactly how long Theodore's assistant had been there. The Brooks family, it seemed, always found a way to stay one step ahead.

He caught himself mid-thought, refusing to let his mind wander too far. He looked again at Theodore's assistant, who stood perfectly still with the same polite expression, as if carved from stone. The man's composure was almost admirable. Everyone working for Theodore carried that same mysterious air, like they'd been trained to stand still for hours without breaking character. He hadn't seen this particular assistant before,though.

Once he'd finished reporting, Theodore's assistant explained, "Mr. Brooks heard Miss Curtis was dining here and asked me to deliver this to her."

He was careful not to bring up the earlier disturbance, keeping his tone neutral and his eyes politely on Marissa.

Both assistants held out documents, and Marissa,having already guessed what they were about,calmly reached out to take the documents from Theodore's assistant. A quick glance was all it took for her to realize they were share transfer forms from the second-biggest investor of Culinary Oasis. She smiled slightly and asked, "So, your boss is one of the owners of Culinary Oasis?"

She'd only ever talked to the other two owners through email and had never actually met any of them face-to-face.

Remembering the secretary Jaxton had just talked about,Marissa's sneered, and her eyes sharpened.

Theodore's assistant had no idea what was inside those papers; he was just following Wilbur's instructions. He avoided meeting Marissa's eyes,knowing that answering her question could get him in trouble.

However, as Theodore's representative, he couldn't exactly stay silent either, not in front of Marc.
From what he knew, Theodore had nothing to do with Culinary Oasis, and the Brooks family definitely didn't dabble in the restaurant business.
He gave a courteous smile. "I'm sorry, Miss Curtis.You'll need to ask Mr. Brooks directly."
After all, he was only the messenger.
It was safer to let the main parties sort things out themselves.

"Oh." Marissa's tone turned lighter, almost teasing.She gave the folder a soft tap with her fingers while looking at him.

Theodore's assistant just kept that polite, practiced smile.

Marc's assistant hesitated before instinctively reaching forward to hand over another set of papers.

All three pairs of eyes instantly turned toward him.
Caught off guard, he almost pulled his hand back,but Marissa reached out and took the papers from him as well, treating it no differently than before. She skimmed through the pages, then lifted her gaze to Marc.

"Do you like it?" Marc asked casually as they headed toward the exit together.
Theodore's assistant paused for a moment, then followed behind.

"I do," Marissa replied easily. She wasn't the type to be overly formal with Marc. She liked the gifts that Theodore and Marc had given her.
Now Culinary Oasis was hers alone, even if it was just the Ozreka branch.

"Glad you like it," Marc said, giving her a gentle pat on the head. Still, a flicker of guilt passed through him-if he'd handled things better earlier, this whole mess could've been avoided.

Marissa went straight to the point. "So, did you negotiate for those shares, Marc?"
She knew the third owner's personality. They weren't the type to give in easily. Whoever they were, they hid behind a voice changer every time they spoke. To this day, she still had no idea if it was a man or woman.

Somehow, the other two owners had agreed to hand over shares to Theodore and Marc. Was it really that easy?
"Yeah." Marc nodded, smiling gently. "I didn't expect you to be the big boss, Rissa. I was planning to wait until you were done with those people before sending the papers over."
Things, however, hadn't exactly gone as he'd planned.

"Then you should give these back," Marissa said firmly. She didn't plan to keep something that wasn't earned. To her, taking what didn't belong to her wasn't the right thing to do. After saying that,she turned and handed the other folder to Theodore's assistant walking behind them.

The other two owners were both cunning businessmen. Maybe they had already caught wind of her ties to Theodore and Marc?
###Chapter58 Then Let's See Who Wins In The End
Theodore's assistant regretted following Marissa.He should've headed back to the office and reported to Theodore that his task was done.

He stepped back, hands at his sides, avoiding the documents offered.

"Just accept those shares, Marissa," Marc said firmly, a rare edge in his voice around his sister. He sensed Marissa's swirling thoughts. Opening the car door, he gestured for her to get in first. "It's no big deal for Theodore and me."
Just then, a figure crept closer.
Rosie took advantage of her petite frame, slipping under Marc's arm and darting into the car. She quickly settled beside Marissa. Marissa's faint smile vanished, replaced by a cold,unreadable expression. Rosie, looking disheveled after being thrown out by security, hurriedly straightened her clothes and forced a bright smile. "Miss, could you give me a ride? Just drop me at the plaza ahead." Having finally gotten close to the Curtis family,
Rosie wasn't about to let the chance slip away.
"Get out," Marc snapped. He had held back before,but her persistence tested his patience.

Marc's assistant, who had just opened the front passenger door, froze in surprise at his boss' tone.When he turned, he noticed the unfamiliar young woman in the back seat and quickly stepped forward to remove her.

Rosie shrank back, clutching at Marissa's sleeve to avoid his grasp.
"Get out," Marissa said flatly, The assistant was startled and retreated rapidly when Rosie was thrust directly into his arms.
Rosie hit the ground with a thud outside the car,the impact jarring her senses.

She hadn't expected Marissa to have such an edge to her.

Back at Culinary Oasis, Marissa had been calm and soft-spoken. Rosie realized she had completely misread her.

For a moment, Rosie just sat there in shock, staring up at the people in the car.

"Getting in?" Marc asked casually from inside, glancing toward Theodore's assistant who stood by the door.

The mnan shook his head slightly and gestured behind him. "I should head back and report to Mr.Brooks."

Marc gave a short nod, leaning back in his seat.Only then did Marissa come into view, seated quietly behind him.

"Miss Curtis, I'll be leaving now," the man said politely.

Marissa gave a small nod in acknowledgment.

As soon as the car door began to close, Rosie snapped out of her daze and wedged herself between the door and the frame, crying out pitifully, "Sir, please-give me a ride! I just broke up with Bernie, and he went mad. He's going to hit me! Please,help me!"

Her voice trembled as she clung to Marc's leg,tears streaking her face.
She knew men like him hated public drama-his reputation was her last hope.

When Marc didn't react, Rosie's panic deepened.She turned desperately toward Marissa, her voice raw. "Miss, you're a woman too! Are you really going to watch Bernie drag me off? If he catches me,he'll kill me!"

Marissa rested her cheek on her hand, her tone flat and detached. "Even if he does, that's not my concern."

For a second, Rosie was speechless.

Fine-then they couldn't blame her for what was coming next.
Her face twisted with anger, ready to lash out,when Miriam suddenly appeared. She grabbed Rosie firmly by the arm and yanked her to her feet.Without so much as glancing at the people in the car,she said apologetically, "I'm sorry. Rosie isn't herself today. Please don't take it to heart."

Rosie's eyes went wide with fury.
How dare Miriam ruin her plan! "I'll take her back to the hospital," Miriam added quickly, stealing a glance at Marc before addressing Marissa. She reached into her pocket and offered a business card. "Here's my contact information."Marissa didn't even look at it. "If she's unstable,make sure she gets proper treatment. Don't let her wander around like this," she said coolly.Miriam's hand stiffened before she pulled the card back.

Seeing a chance, Rosie jerked free and screamed,thrashing in protest. "Miriam, I know what you're up to! Let go of me!"
But Miriam's patience had run dry. Her eyes went cold as she shoved Rosie's head down, hissing through clenched teeth, "Shut up, you bitch."

"Get in," Marissa ordered sharply, slamming the car door shut and startling Marc's assistant into motion.

Marissa also saw through Miriam's intentions.
Both women clearly had their sights set on Marc.
Marc's assistant quickly slipped into the car.
As the vehicle pulled away, Theodore's assistant discreetly took out his phone, snapping a quick photo of the two women still grappling on the ground. Then he turned to leave.

"You bitch!" Rosie roared as she scrambled up,slapping Miriam hard across the face, her eyes flashing with rage. "Don't think you can use me as a stepping stone to get close to Mr. Curtis!"
Miriam's lips curved into a cold, mocking sneer.She seized Rosie by the hair, yanking her head back as she hissed, "Whatever I've set my eyes on,
you'd better stay far away from."
Rosie spat at the ground, a dark smile curling her lips. "Still the same shameless snake, I see."
After all, she had met Marc first.
"Then let's see who wins in the end," Miriam said icily, releasing her grip and walking off without another glance, leaving Rosie standing there,trembling with fury.
###Chapter59 How Could She Treat Me This Way
"Mom, my teddy bear dropped." A little girl's voice rose as she and her mother walked past Rosie.

Right by the crosswalk, the plush toy rolled to Rosie's feet. With a sharp glare, she kicked it away,stomping the ground in a fury as if her rage could crack the pavement itself.
"That bitch! Go to hell!" she hissed.

Alarm flashed across the mother's face. She quickly cupped her daughter's mouth, scooped her up, and rushed off to the side, unwilling to risk a scene with a woman who clearly looked unhinged.

The rest of the onlookers didn't dare linger either.One by one, they slipped away, pretending not to have seen anything at all.
By the time Rosie's outburst burned out, Miriam had already disappeared.

"Mr. Curtis, Miss Curtis, I think there's a car trailing us," the driver said after a few minutes on the road.He kept checking the rearview mirror, noting the vehicle's careful distance. Marissa lifted her gaze to the mirror. The car didn't belong to Theodore's assistant. Could it be Rosie and Miriam?

"Drive faster," Marissa said, her voice steady but firm.

Without hesitation, the driver pressed harder on the gas. The car surged forward, the hum of the engine deepening as he drove faster for several minutes before subtly easing off. Behind them, the trailing vehicle mirrored every move, never straying too far nor too close.

"Could it be enemies?" Marissa asked, her brow furrowing. Though she wasn't deeply familiar with the Curtis family's affairs, she knew that families of great wealth always had those who envied them.

"Let it be," Marc said, his tone calm as his eyes flicked toward the mirror.

"Whoever they are, they're bold," Marissa said, a faint smile tugging at her lips. "Going after the Curtis family in Ozreka takes real nerve."

"Get rid of them," Marc said.
At once, the driver picked up speed again. His hands were steady on the wheel, every turn sharp and precise-a display of practiced control that would impress even the most seasoned driver.Although the other car tried to keep up, it couldn't match his skill. Within moments, the pursuers were nothing more than distant headlights swallowed by the night.

Elsewhere, at the Fletcher family's villa.
A shadow fell over Evelina's expression. She recognized Jenna's voice in the background during the call Myrna made to Marissa.
Jenna was at Bryson's side in the hospital,which could only mean one thing-Marissa was there too and had crossed paths with them.

That despicable woman!
How on earth did she discover that Bryson was in the hospital?

"Mom, I have to go there right now before Marissa starts feeding Bryson her nonsense," Evelina said,heading straight for the door.

Panic clawed at her chest. The thought of Bryson alone with Marissa made her stomach twist. What if that woman poisoned his mind against her?

"Hold on! I'm coming with you!" Susanna shouted,but Evelina was already gone before she could take another step.

"Foolish child!" Susanna muttered, glaring at the
doorway. Frustration and worry mingled in her eyes as she watched her daughter disappear from view.

"Why is it that you can reach Marissa by phone while I can't, Myrna?" Susanna asked, her attention divided as she messaged someone on WhatsApp to arrange a gown fitting for Evelina.

Caught off guard, Myrna hesitated before replying,"I don't know."

"Well, I'll look it up myself," Susanna said, brushing her hand dismissively as she began typing into the search bar: reasons why a phone call didn't go through.

While Susanna was preoccupied, Myrna took the opportunity to slip away toward the kitchen-but she barely made it past the doorway before Becky grabbed her by the arm.

"You nearly gave me a heart attack!" Myrna hissed,glaring at her. Becky darted a glance toward the living room before whispering, "Tell me what's happening.Wasn't Mr. Hardy supposed to be engaged to Marissa? How did it turn into Evelina all of a sudden?" Knowing a little more than Becky, Myrna leaned in and murmured, "Evelina is actually the real daughter of the Fletcher family. Marissa isn't related to them by blood at all."

"Ah, that explains everything," Becky said with a nod, her expression brightening with sudden clarity.

"As I thought, that insolent girl actually had the nerve to block my number!" Susanna's temper flared as she scrolled through the search results on her phone.

Explanations like poor signal and unpaid bills flashed across the screen, but she dismissed them with a scoff.

She believed the reason was that Marissa had blocked her.

"Damn it!" Susanna shouted, her voice echoing through the room. In a blind fury, she swept the table clean with one arm, sending papers and trinkets flying, then kicked the chair over with a loud crack.

Every servant within earshot froze. One by one,they shrank into corners, holding their breath and praying she wouldn't notice them.

When the chaos settled, Susanna's chest rose and fell sharply. She fixed her gaze on the phone screen, her expression darkening. A bitter laugh escaped her lips as she muttered, "Now that she's chosen to turn her back on me, then she'll have no one to blame when I strike back."
Becky's stomach tightened at the sight of Susanna's wicked grin. A chill ran down her spine,and for a fleeting moment, she nearly grabbed her phone to warn Marissa right then and there, only stopping herself because Myrna was standing nearby.

Without wasting another second, Susanna dialed Phil's number.
The moment the call went through, her tone shifted into one of utter despair. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she said, "Darling, you won't believe what just happened. I tried calling Marissa, and she's blocked me completely... All I did was tell her not to fight with Evelina over Bryson, and she cast aside all the affection l've given her through the years! It hurts so much, darling. How could she treat me this way? After everything Evelina has suffered before coming home, is it so wrong that l show her a little more care?"
###Chapter60 We Should Release A Statement
The Fletcher family's servant slipped in through the side door, arms full of groceries, when she caught Susanna's unsettling grin. A shiver ran through her,urging her to dart into the kitchen.

Susanna's demeanor had grown stranger by the day.Once refined and poised, she now carried on like a brash street vendor, her voice echoing even into the kitchen.

Susanna continued speaking into the phone to her husband, "I thought Marissa would treat Evelina nicely,but she's so selfish! Not only does she refuse to embrace Evelina like we do, but she can't even handle Evelina taking back what is rightfully hers! She has had so much already and still wants more, always jealous and competing with Evelina!We raised her all these years, and she doesn't even show gratitude! She thinks I shouldn't have scolded her in front of everyone! If she hadn't stirred up trouble at Evelina and Bryson's wedding, would I have had to? Honey, don't you think she really goes too far?"

After venting, Susanna fished for Phil's support. Unlike her, his focus wasn't solely on Evelina;he had broader concerns.

To him, Marissa had always been dutiful and reasonable. If not for Susanna's and Evelina's public jabs, Phil had other plans for Marissa,though he couldn't share them with Susanna in front of company staff.
He turned his phone's volume to a whisper, audible only to him.

When Susanna got no reply, her face darkened,and she asked suspiciously, "Honey, are you at the company?"

She wondered if he was with some secret lover.

Unaware of the shift in her tone because of the low volume, Phil replied, "Didn't I already tell you?Something came up at the company, so I'm dealing with it."

"Oh." Susanna kicked aside a stray object, and seeing the mess she had made, she bellowed,"Someone clean this up!"

The servants hurried out, silently clearing the clutter from the floor.

Plopped on the sofa, Susanna's anger festered as she  ranted, "Marissa is just like her low-class slum parents, demanding hundreds of thousands like it's nothing. She need a reality check. Is she worth that much? That wretch should go to hell..."

The servants tidying the living room exchanged discreet eye-rolls.

Meanwhile, Phil's face grew icy in the conference room as Susanna's crude tirade continued."Enough with the cursing," he said, unable to stomach her vulgarity.
"I..." Susanna's shrill complaints faltered at Phil's cool response, her tone shifting. "I'm just so frustrated-we've raised an ungrateful brat!"

Phil's expression soured. He thought he knew Marissa, who had grown up under his care. In his view, she should have played along to liven up the wedding's drama.

But Marissa cared little for the family and chose to walk away.

"You know Marissa's temperament. Young people are touchy and can act rashly. It's normal for her to shut us out when she's upset. We shouldn't hold grudges against her. I've got things to handle here;I'll call you back," Phil comforted her.
Clutching the phone, Susanna bowed her head slightly, her disheveled hair from her earlier outburst falling over her forehead, hiding the shadow in her eyes.

Getting no response, Phil thought the call had dropped and was about to pass the phone to his assistant when Susanna spoke. "We should release a statement."

"About what?" Phil asked.
"That Evelina is our real daughter, and Marissa is the one we brought home by mistake." Susanna's tone was earnest, dripping with affection for Evelina. "Now is the time to set things straight. If the wedding drama spreads before we make the announcement, it will get messier. Honey,you know how vicious online comments can be. Evelina is so sensitive-I'm worried she will overthink if she reads some negative comments." Phil had already planned to have the PR team draft a statement. Hearing Susanna, he quickly soothed her with a gentle tone. "Don't worry, honey, I'm already on it. Everyone will know that Evelina is our real daughter. Trust me, I will take care of everything." On the sofa, Susanna dabbed at her dry eyes, her face betraying a flicker of triumph as she sobbed,"Honey, really? Won't this upset Marissa?" "Marissa is reasonable," Phil reassured her. "She understands what this statement means right now.Don't worry, it's fine. She won't be upset with us;it's just setting things right."

"What about the dividends we planned for Marissa?" Susanna's grip on the phone tightened,her voice laced with concern. "I accidentally let it slip in front of Evelina..."
###Chapter61 Doesn't The Woman Look Like Marissa
Phil's brow creased at Susanna's words. Was Marissa stirring up trouble at the wedding just to muscle in on the dividends?

"I can't believe she's become so money-hungry."Phil's expression hardened, though he kept his voice steady. "Don't dwell on it. I'll sort it out."
"But,honey..." Susanna began.
"Enough. Dry your tears." Phil rubbed his temples,remembering the important banquet he had to attend that evening. "There's a big event tonight.Go get ready, and call me when you're done. I'll have someone pick you up."

Susanna sniffled, putting on a lovelorn tone. "Can't you come pick me up yourself?"

"If I finish early, I will." With that, Phil ended the call and tossed his phone to his assistant. The PR team sprang into action, preparing the statement Phil had requested to release at the appointed time. Meanwhile, an intern from Fletcher Group named Berkley Reid-who had been guided by Marissa-stumbled across a hot topic on the internet.

"Mr. Marc Curtis and his partner were spotted dining out."

"Mr. Marc Curtis is getting married soon."

"Marc Curtis and his girlfriend made their first public appearance."

During the afternoon tea break, the break room buzzed with colleagues swapping the latest rumors.

"The new CEO of Curtis Group was seen eating out with a girlfriend?" Berkley read aloud, shifting from casual to shocked as she scrolled through the trending piece.

Her voice pulled several coworkers over.
Some of them fumbled for their phones to check.

"No way-isn't Marc single?
How is he suddenly out with a woman? Ah! I'm so sad!" "He pretended to be single the whole time and you fell for it? You're too trusting!" "Exactly. The rich have messy private lives; they're just better at keeping them out of the headlines." "Hey, Berkley, look at the photo. Doesn't the woman look like Marissa? The profile is so familiar."

An employee zoomed in on the photo, revealing a woman stepping out of a Rolls-Royce while Marc bent down to speak with her.

The photographer likely hadn't meant to catch such a scene. The camera had wobbled at just the wrong moment, making the figures blur into one another. In the shots that followed, only their backs and faint side profiles were visible.

The woman's face was mostly hidden, but the man's-clear as day-was unmistakably MAarc's.
"I don't think so. Marissa's not that skinny. That can't be her!"

"Exactly. Marissa's got a toned figure, not this frail build.Definitely not Marissa."
"Come on, are you guys saying that just because you can't stand the thought of Marc being taken?"

"What kind of nonsense is that? We're not delusional fangirls. No need to throw shade at anyone!" one of the employees shot back.

Then she typed into the comment section of her gossip account. "My heart is shattered-Marc is taken." "I'm serious, though," another insisted, squinting at the photo. "This side profile-it really looks like Marissa. I'm sure of it." She leaned closer,studying the blurred image with practiced precision. She'd always had an exceptional memory for faces and rarely got them wrong.

"Missing her already?" someone teased, earning a few quiet laughs.

In truth, hardly anyone in Marissa's department at Fletcher Group knew her real background. She didn't resemble Phil or Susanna much, and her modest demeanor gave nothing away.

When she'd first joined the company, Phil and Susanna had been adamant-she was to hide her identity as the Fletcher family's daughter and work her way up like everyone else.

Coincidentally, Evelina had joined the company at the same time.

She didn't last long in Marissa's department,though-after struggling to meet expectations, she was quietly moved elsewhere. Still, her resemblance to Phil had sparked whispers across the company.

Meanwhile, Marissa never used her family name to her advantage.
If anything, her association with Evelina caused more problems. Many assumed she'd used connections to land her job, and she faced more than her share of cold shoulders and snide remarks. But Marissa's quiet determination and steady competence eventually earned her colleagues' respect.
Only a handful of people at Fletcher Group knew who she truly was-and among them were the PR staff preparing Phil's statement.
One of them, pausing mid-sip during her coffee break, overheard the gossip floating from across the room. Curious, she set down her cup and asked, "Who's this woman that looks like Marissa?Let me see."
###Chapter 62 Gossip



"We're just joking around."The woman who spoke earlier quickly brushed off the tension and threw a brief,uneasy glance at her bewildered coworker.

Rivalries  were  common   between   departments. Their  own  department  head  had  long-standing issues with the PR team,which meant they had to keep their distance,too.Inside the same company walls,they acted like strangers.

The  second  woman  ried  to  stay  composed.She didn't  hide  her  phone  right  away  because  that would draw attention.Instead,she calmly passed it over to the PR staff.
Those  who   knew  Marissa  well  were  certain   it wasn't her.It didn't make sense for someone from PR,who had barely exchanged a word with her,to recognize her at all.

And  the  woman's  assumption  turned  out  to  be right.The PR staff had never met Marissa.She had only asked about the photo because a "Marissa" was   mentioned   in   the   statement   she   was preparing.

After taking a few more looks at the picture,she

found nothing special about it.

"You agree it doesn't look like Marissa,don't you?" one  colleague  said,taking  a  sip  from  her  drink."I told her it wasn't Marissa,but she insisted the side profile  matched.Pretty  women  tend  to  share  the same features anyway.I could show you dozens of similar faces if you want."

While   pouring   coffee,the   PR   employee   said,"I can't see the resemblance either."
With    her   cup    emptied,she   exchanged   quick goodbyes  with  a  few  coworkers  before  heading back to the PR office.
As  soon  as  she  was  gone,the  talk  turned  right back to Marissa.
"I still believe it's Marissa,"someone said,squinting
at  the  photo  as  if  each  glance  proved  her  point even more.
"Do  you  miss  her  already?She's  been  gone  for almost two weeks,"the other said,letting out a sigh tinged  with  frustration."I've   been  messaging  her every  day,but  she  hasn't  replied  to  any  of  them. Something must have happened for her to stay on leave this long."

"Probably something serious."

Their small group fell into easy chatter again,their voices light but curious.

"Look  at  this  headline.It  says  two  daughters  from the same rich family in Ozreka are fighting over one man."
"Oh,those    sisters    had    an    argument    at    the wedding."

"Do  the  rich  ever  run  out  of  drama?Enough  with the gossip.Let's get back to work!"

"Hold  on.Doesn't  the  woman's  side  profile  in  that video remind you of Marissa?"

One of the coworkers pinched the screen to zoom in on the image.

"Oh  wow,you're  right!It  really  does!"

"Wait,let me have a look too!"

"See?The   angle   looks   just   like   Marissa's.That's exactly what I was saying—beautiful women tend to share   the   same   kind   of   features!"


"Hang  on  a  second.Doesn't  the  woman  standing beside   her   look   like   Evelina?"


Before   the   conversation   could   spiral   further,a colleague   placed   an   arm   around   the   younger woman's shoulders and gently steered her back to

her  desk."Enough  about  that.There  are  tons  of people who look alike.Quit snooping and focus on work."
"Ugh,why is it that luck never finds me?Everyone else seems to be getting rich,"one of them said as they  all  trudged  back  to  their  stations,laughing under their breath.
While  everyone  returned  to  their  desks,photos from  the  wedding  began  spreading  across  the internet,instantly  catching  public  attention.Online headlines exploded with sensational claims.

"Chaos  unfolds  among  the  elite  as  two  women from  a  powerful  family  battle  over  one  man.The so-called  heiress  turns  out  to  be  a  fraud,stealing the real one's fiancé ."

"A shocking tale where life imitates fiction:the fake heiress and the genuine one."

"Curtis  Group's  CEO  goes  all  out  to  pamper  his mysterious girlfriend."

"Breaking news:the identity of the CEO's girlfriend is finally revealed!"

Despite   the    storm   brewing   online,the   diligent employees  paid  no  mind.They  focused  on  their screens,lost in their work.

Inside  the  office,the  rapid  clatter  of  keyboards filled the air.

Berkley,who always blended into the background,
pushed up her glasses and sneaked a glance at her coworkers.Gathering      courage,she      discreetly pulled  out  her  phone  and  typed  a  message  to Marissa.

Somewhere else,Marissa's phone buzzed just as she was heading to have her makeup done.

The    message     read,"Marissa,everyone's wondering  when   you're   coming   back.Are   you planning to return?"

Earlier,Marissa had casually mentioned her plan to resign  so  she  could  focus  on  something  of  her
own.


None    of    her    coworkers    knew    about    that conversation.
Berkley  assumed  Marissa  had  already  secured another job and even thought about following her lead.Life  at  Fletcher  Group  was  exhausting,and she'd grown tired of the endless workload paired with low pay and little room for advancement.

Instead  of answering  privately,Marissa  opened  a group   chat,which   included   a   handful   of  their closest colleagues.

The    chat,usually    quiet    during    work    hours, suddenly came alive with chatter.

"How are you supposed to  make  money  if  you're not  working?"


"Dream on."

"Ah!How cruel of you."

A   faint   gleam   of   humor   in   Marissa's   usually composed   eyes   as   her   fingers   danced   swiftly across the screen.
"With  a  million  dollars,you  could  live  comfortably just on the interest."

"Marissa,you have a point!"

"Hey,don't  tease  me  like  that.I  don't  even  have  a hundred thousand to my name."

"Please,Marissa,come   back   soon!I   can't    handle  all  this  alone.I'm  on  the  verge  of  breaking  down. Evelina's  been  slacking  off  again—she  didn't  even show up today!"

Evelina   had   moved   to    another   department,but while  Marissa  was  on  leave,she  somehow  found her way back.

Before    Marissa   stepped    away,she'd    closed   a massive  deal,and  everyone  in  the  office  quietly

assumed Evelina returned just in time to take the credit.
###Chapter 63 Keep Monitoring Her



Evelina  was  shameless;she  had  taken  credit  for other people's work on multiple occasions.

Her striking resemblance to both Phil and Susanna fueled  whispers  of  a  deeper  connection,making colleagues   wary   of   crossing   her.The   mystery deepened when she audaciously claimed Marissa's efforts  as  her  own,intensifying  speculation  about her true origins.

Some  coworkers  theorized  she  might  be  Phil's secret child from an affair.
Others  argued  she  could  be  the   Fletchers'real daughter.

It was common knowledge at Fletcher Group that Phil  and  Susanna  had  a  single  daughter,fiercely sheltered from the public eye,unlike the daughters of  other  affluent  families  who  were  flaunted   at galas.

In all their years at the company,no employee had ever met this elusive daughter.

Phil  and  Susanna's  public  displays  of  devotion, coupled  with  his  scandal-free  reputation,stood  in stark contrast to other CEOs who kept mistresses

behind their wives'backs after striking it rich.

Yet,beyond  her  looks,Evelina  didn't  match  the staff's vision of the Fletcher daughter—expected to
be   polished,dignified,and            well-informed,not
someone lacking fundamental skills.

Questions swirled among colleagues,but answers remained elusive.
A coworker bombarded Marissa's phone with texts, venting about Evelina's habitual lateness and poor work ethic in a group chat created solely to dissect her identity,from which Evelina was excluded.

Marissa  paused,reflecting.

Her ties to the Fletcher family were broken,leaving nothing she wished to cling to.

"I  will  be  back  soon,"she  texted,then  closed  the chat.
Meanwhile,Bryson,wrapping      up      his      tasks, received  a   report  from  his  assistant,who  began with a brief summary.

"When   Marissa   left   the   chapel.."The   assistant faltered,visibly   confused.

Bryson looked up.

The  assistant  continued,"The  security  personnel

claimed she was picked up by a garbage truck."

"A    garbage    truck?"Bryson's     brow    furrowed, stunned  that  the  Fletcher  family,after  raising  her for  over  two  decades,hadn't  arranged  an  escort, even if she wasn't their blood.
The assistant confirmed,"Witnesses said the truck sped off right after,and there has been no trace of her since."
Handing  Bryson the  report,the assistant faced  his next question.

"Did you find out  how she ended  up at  Harmony Hospital?"Bryson   inquired,intrigued   by   Marissa's unexpected appearance there and her behavior at the time.

The   assistant   shared    Bryson's   curiosity   about Marissa's sudden presence at the hospital.

"The  hospital  staff  were  tight-lipped  about  what happened   between   3:00   and   4:30   p m.that    afternoon.Rumors  point to a  major surgery for an important figure,but details are scarce."

When  the  assistant  questioned  a  nurse  for  more information,a  man  in  an  upscale  suit—identical  to Bryson's  preferred  brand-appeared.He  shot  her  a silencing glance that made her shudder.

Sensing    the    nurse's    palpable    discomfort,the assistant refrained from probing further.

He was struck that even a bodyguard for such an important   figure   wore   suits   as   expensive   as Bryson's.It  was  a  clear  indication  they  were  not people he could trifle with.

Bryson fixed his gaze on the assistant,who,feeling the  weight  of  his  stare,wondered  if  Bryson  was displeased with the investigation's progress.

Having spent over a thousand dollars of his own money,the  assistant  had  uncovered  only  minimal details.

"I  overheard  that  several  specialists  were  there, including   two   globally   recognized   doctors,"the assistant  added   cautiously,relaying  what   he  had overheard.

He   hadn't   intended   to   share   this,as   it   was unverified  gossip  from  a  girl,making  its  accuracy uncertain.
Bryson's  face   remained   stern,his   brows   slightly knit,betraying  no  emotion  as  he  took  the  tablet from  the  assistant,glanced  at  it,and  swiped  the screen  casually."Nothing  on   Marissa's  fiancé?"he
asked.

The  assistant,unable  to  trace   how  Marissa  even

reached the hospital,had no hope of investigating an unknown stranger.
He shook his head and said,"This is all we've got so far."
New   to   Bryson's   team,with   Bryson   himself   a company  novice  lacking  the  senior  executives' resources,the   assistant   found   the   investigation daunting.

He had also learned that Bryson's newlywed wife, Evelina,was Marissa's sister.
How could he delve deeper?He wouldn't dare.

the       tablet,directing,
"Keep monitoring The    assistant
Hardy."

He  was   inwardly  confused.Why  was   Bryson  so fixated on his sister-in-law?
Bryson   felt   that   something   was   amiss,but   he couldn't   put   his   finger   on   it.With   a   surge   of irritation,he  loosened   his  tie  and  unbuttoned  his jacket.

He  planned  to   discuss  Marissa  with   Evelina  at home.

Thinking of Evelina,Bryson's expression softened.

Her  simplicity,which  he  adored,meant  he  should avoid  direct  confrontation  and  approach  the  topic delicately.

Knowing  Marissa  harbored  feelings  for  him,he felt he should help if she ever struggled.
###Chapter 64 She'd Managed To Pique His Curiosity
Jenna     rubbed     her     temples,the     persistent headache from several sleepless  nights  pounding behind her eyes.

She  had  run  out  of  the   essential  oils   Marissa recommended  and   hadn't   had  time  to   replace them.
Watching   Bryson   order   his   assistant   to   keep monitoring  Marissa  intensified  her  headache.Her frown  deepened,and  with   a  hint  of  irritation,she asked,"Bryson,what's   with   all   this   attention   on Marissa?She's  just  the  adopted  daughter  of  the Fletcher family!If Evelina finds out,she'll  be  upset. You're married to her now,so focus on your wife, understand?"

Her tone softened as she continued.When Jenna wasn't    upset,her    demeanor    was     calm    and approachable.

"You're  reading  too  much  into  it,"Bryson  replied with a faint smile."I'm married to Evelina.The only reason I have my assistant keep an eye on Marissa is that she's Evelina's sister.Nothing more."

He handed his suit jacket to his assistant,his eyes scanning the parking lot.

Among the scattered people,Marissa was nowhere in   sight.He    lowered   his   gaze,suppressing   the irritation   building    inside   him."Let's   go,"he    said flatly.

Jenna   knew   that   look.Whenever   Bryson   didn't
want to answer,he'd change the subject—just like noW.
She  glanced  around,not  spotting  Marissa,and  felt a small sense of relief
"Bryson,did    you    hear    me?"she    pressed."You must  never  betray  Evelina.She  is  far  superior  to her in every way."

Her voice carried genuine worry that her son might get involved with Marissa.

"Mom,how  can  you  think  that  of  me?"Bryson's tone   hardened,his    expression   darkening.Evelina had cared for him selflessly during his darkest time —he could never betray her.

Jenna   hesitated,catching   the  shift   in   his expression.She  said  quickly,"I  just  don't  want  you to lose your senses like so many men do.Evelina's been good to you—don't let her down."

"Then  stop  overworking  her,"Bryson   said   sharply as he opened the car door,gesturing for her to get in."We  have  servants.In  the   Fletcher  family,she never  had  to  lift  a  finger.If  her  mother  finds  out how   you're    treating   her,it'll   turn    into   another argument."

Jenna slid  into the  seat,biting  back  a  retort.When she  saw  her  son's  face  darken  again,she  raised her   hands   in   surrender."Alright,alright,I   get   it.I'll treat her better."
She almost  blurted  out  that  Evelina  hadn't  grown up pampered like Marissa,who used to personally prepare   medicine   for    Bryson,but   she   stopped herself.

Bryson  was  sharp;he'd  piece  together  the  truth immediately.

"Anyway,"Jenna   said    instead,"don't    give   other girls too much attention."

"Relax,I'm loyal to my wife,just like my father is to you,"Bryson  said  with   a  light  smile,clearly   done with the topic.

Jenna  forced   a   small   laugh.The   truth   was,his father had been seeing other women behind their backs.

In  the  front  seat,the  assistant  stayed  quiet  while

the Hardy family's chauffeur was behind the wheel. Minutes passed,but the car didn't move.
"What's   going    on?"Bryson   asked,checking   his watch.
He  hated  delays.Since  regaining  his  eyesight,he couldn't stand being idle at home,often visiting the company instead.

"Mr.Hardy,I'll    check    it    right    away,"the    driver replied,stepping out to inspect the car.

"Didn't you  check  it  before  we  left?"Jenna  asked impatiently."Hurry   up,please."

A  pounding  headache throbbed  behind  her  eyes. She hadn't slept well in days and just wanted to get home and rest.
The driver circled the vehicle,crouched down for a closer  look,and  quickly  realized what was wrong. Straightening   up,he   reported  through  the  open window,"Mr.Hardy,all four tires are flat."

Bryson's  brow  furrowed.He  glanced  outside."How did that happen?"he asked,his tone sharp.
The driver was just as baffled.The tires had been perfectly fine when they arrived—so how could all four suddenly go flat?It was far too coincidental to be an accident.He furrowed his brows,recalling his

brief absence.

"Mr.Hardy,"the   driver   said   cautiously,"I'm   sorry. About ten minutes ago,I went to the restroom."

Ten minutes ago?

Could it be...

The assistant glanced cautiously at Bryson through the   rearview   mirror.Wasn't   that   when   Marissa appeared?

Bryson's   expression   darkened   instantly   as   the same thought crossed his mind.

So,Marissa came all the way to the hospital just to slash his tires?

Unbelievable.

Bryson snorted in derision.

So  this  was   how   Marissa   planned  to  get   his attention?
He   had   to   admit,she'd   managed   to   pique   his curiosity.
"What exactly is going on?"Jenna asked,her brow creasing in confusion.

"Nothing,"Bryson  replied  casually,though  his  mind replayed the  image  of  Marissa's  confident,radiant



face as she walked away.

"What is really going on?"Jenna pressed,glancing between him and the driver.

"The tires were  deliberately  slashed,"Bryson  said flatly  before  pushing the door open and stepping out of the car.He turned back to his mother."Mom, I'll  take  a  cab  to  the  office.Wait  here—Dad  said he'd come pick you up."

"What?Hold   on,Bryson,"Jenna   called   after   him, but  he  had  already  moved  past  the  car,his  long strides   carrying   him   down   the   street   without looking back.

The  assistant  quickly  got  out  of  the  car  as  well. Before  following  Bryson,he  leaned  toward  Jenna with   a   respectful   nod."Madam,I'll   go   with   Mr. Hardy."
###Chapter 65 You Need To Win His Heart



Bryson  and   his  assistant  departed   before  Jenna could say another word.

Her face was  set  in  a  cold,stern  mask.The  driver stood quietly nearby,afraid to make a sound.

Jenna  was  worried   Bryson  might  go  looking  for Marissa the moment she wasn't watching.

After   a    moment's    hesitation,she   grabbed    her handbag  and  stepped  out  of  the  car  without  a word.
The  driver  didn't  dare  stop  her.Instead,he  quickly pulled  out   his  phone  and   called  Bryson's  father, Kasen Hardy.

Just  then,Evelina's  car  pulled  up  at  the  hospital entrance.Spotting  Jenna   by   the   roadside,Evelina rolled  down   her  window   and   called  out,"Jenna! Where's  Bryson?"

Although  Jenna   had  promised  Bryson  she  would treat  Evelina better,seeing her now only fueled her irritation,since she was already in a foul mood.

"Bryson's    busy    with     company    matters,"Jenna replied sharply.When Evelina got out of the car and

walked   toward   her,Jenna   immediately   started scolding."What's    going    on    with    you?   Your husband's  in the  hospital,and you're  nowhere to be  found!Do  you  even  know   Marissa  was  just here?"
Evelina's  eyes widened."She  didn't  say  anything improper to Bryson,did she?"

Her  usually  sweet  expression  darkened.If  she'd known Marissa would show up at the hospital,she would have dropped everything to come sooner.

"Bryson's  medication  ran  out,so  I  went  to  my parents'house   to   get   more,"Evelina   explained quickly,her voice tinged with regret.It had been a pointless trip—she should've stayed by his side.

Whoever got the medicine didn't matter.She ought to have remained with him!
"Couldn't someone from the  Fletcher family have brought   it  to  you?Did  you   really   need   to   go yourself?"Jenna     said,her     tone     heavy     with disapproval."You're     not     just     your     parents' daughter  anymore,Evelina.You're   Bryson's  wife. Start acting like it."

Evelina's expression shifted.

Since  returning  to  the  Fletcher  family,few  people dared   to   lecture   her—except   Jenna.If   not   for

Bryson,s he wouldn't tolerate it at all.

She forced  herself  to  stay  calm,resting  a  hand  on her  stomach.Perhaps  if  she  were  pregnant  with Bryson's son,Jenna might be more gentle with her.

"You're  right,"she  said with  a  practiced  smile,as  if the criticism didn't bother her at all.
Evelina slipped  closer and  linked  her  arm  through Jenna's,leaning  on  her  affectionately.The  gesture softened Jenna's  mood.

Jenna's  mood  lifted  as  she  watched  Evelina  nod obediently,her eyes soft and compliant.

Unlike  Marissa,Evelina  never  showed  any  attitude, no   matter   what   was   said.Marissa,however,could stop  Jenna  with  a  cold  stare  before  she  even spoke,leaving  Jenna  deeply  frustrated.

"I  know  you're  reluctant  to  leave  your  parents, Evelina,"Jenna   said,patting   her   hand."But   you've spent less time with Bryson than Marissa.You need to   win   his   heart   before   he   learns   the   truth. Understand?"

After   giving   Evelina   a   pat   on   the   hand,Jenna accompanied her inside the car.

"Yes,I   understand.Thank   you   for   the   advice," Evelina said sweetly.

Inwardly,her   mind   was   a   whirl   of   scattered thoughts.

How did Marissa know Bryson was at the hospital?

Evelina  had  planned  a  makeover  with  Susanna, while Jenna got a  message from  Kasen  about  a banquet.

They  chose  a  private  makeup  studio  known  for serving celebrities.

The city was alive with neon lights and a bustling nightlife throughout the  bright  summer  months.All over  the   streets,handsome   men   and   attractive women were speaking and laughing in groups,their happy voices blending with the continuous blaring of automobiles.
In  the   Rolls-Royce,Marc   tapped   on   his   tablet, signing a document.
"I'll send you a guest list later with family bios,"he said to Marissa."No need to memorize it."
Marissa  nodded,exhaustion  weighing  on  her,and closed her eyes to rest before they arrived.

High-society banquets were more exhausting than entertaining,as   the    guests   were    all   influential figures,requiring    careful    navigation    of     every conversation.

Seeing  her  tired,Marc felt  a  twinge  of sympathy. He set the tablet aside,deciding she didn't need to deal with strangers'names.

Ten  minutes  later,the  Rolls-Royce  pulled  up to a private makeup studio.

"Rissa,we're here,"Marc said softly.

Marissa appeared to be asleep,her breathing even. As  he  reached  to  touch  her  shoulder,her  eyes snapped open.

"Let's go,"he said,pulling his hand back.

Marissa gave a small nod.

She  and   her   brother  stepped  out  of  the  car together.
Lottie  Sutton,the  head  makeup  artist,and  Lisette Mendoza,her  assistant,had  been  waiting  at  the entrance for a while.
They went up to meet the siblings as soon as they stepped outside.
"Hi,Mr.Curtis."Lottie   offered   a   warm    greeting, speaking    to    Marc    first    due    to    their    prior
acquaintance.Then she turned to Marissa,offering her  hand."Hello,Miss.Nice  to  meet  you.I'm  Lottie Sutton."

Lottie  was  dressed  in  a  sleek  spaghetti-strap  gown that     accentuated     her     figure,her     straight      hair swaying  softly  as  she  moved.Everything  about  her —from  her  confident  stance  to  her  effortless  charm —seemed  calculated  to  draw  attention.

Marissa's  cool  gaze  swept  over  her,pausing  briefly on   Lottie's   elegant   yet    slightly    masculine    hands before     lifting     again     to      meet     her     eyes.Her expression                didn't                change;calm,distant, unreadable.
###Chapter     66     Misunderstanding



Under Marissa's gaze,Lottie kept a pleasant smile, her demeanor warm and polite.

Marissa reached out her hand."Nice to meet you. I'm Marissa Fletcher,"she said simply.

As   Lottie   racked   her   brain,she   realized   she couldn't  recall  any  prominent   Fletcher  family  in Ozreka.
In   her  profession,knowing  the   backgrounds  of influential families was  more  than  useful—it  was necessary.
After  a   moment's  thought,she   remembered:the Fletcher family had been featured in a news article she'd seen earlier.
With  a  thoughtful   press  of  her   red   lips,Lottie couldn't   help   but   wonder    how   a   family   as unremarkable as the Fletchers crossed paths with the powerful Curtis family.

This woman was anything but ordinary.

Marc,a  man  whose  schedule was  packed  to  the brim,had personally taken the time to escort her to the makeup studio.

Since midday,the place had turned into a whirlwind of  activity,overflowing  with  opulent  gowns  and glittering  jewelry  worth   more   than   a   hundred million.
All those extravagant items had been sent at the request of Corrine from the Curtis family.

Although   Lottie   knew   the   Curtises   possessed immense  wealth—and  such  a  gesture  might  be trivial for them—her team still treated the day like a royal visit,preparing meticulously for their guest.

Leaning  slightly  toward  Marc,she  said  playfully, "So,it's  her?"
On the way here,Marc's attention had remained on his   phone,juggling  work   even   as   he   escorted Marissa,completely   unaware   of   the    storm   of gossip brewing online.

Matters  like  that  never  reached  him  anyway;the Curtis family had professionals to take care of their public   image   long   before   anything   became   a problem.

Marc guessed that Lottie must have learned from Corrine that Marissa was the Curtis family's long- lost daughter.

At  her  question,he  gave  a  small  nod  and  said, "That's  right."

Before   either   of   them   could   say    more,Marc's phone began to buzz again.

Seeing  his  attention  shift,Lottie  waved  her  hand with  a  grin."Go  handle  your  business.Don't  worry about us.I guarantee you'l be impressed when you see the result later!"
The  moment  she  laid  eyes  on  Marissa,her  mind had  already  begun  shaping  an  image  of  how  to enhance  that  striking  beauty-and  now,the  vision was complete,just waiting to be brought to life.

Ignoring  his  phone  for  a  moment,Marc  turned  to his  sister."I'll  leave  my  assistant  here  with  you.If you need anything,don't hesitate to ask him."

Marissa opened  her mouth to decline,but  his  look of  genuine  concern  made  her  pause.Instead,she gave a gentle nod."Alright.Thank you."

"There's    no    need   for   thanks."Marc    chuckled faintly,his  tone  gentle  as  he  brushed  a  strand  of her   hair   aside."Call   me   right   away   if   anything comes   up,understood?"

Marc  couldn't  shake  off  the  memory  of  what  had happened that afternoon.Even though Marissa had come  out  unscathed,the  incident  unsettled  him.As her  brother,he  wanted   her  to  strike  back immediately   when   someone   offended    her—not

pause to analyze every possible outcome first.

All he truly wanted was for her to live freely,without the weight of such worries pressing on her heart.

When  Marissa  met  his  gaze,she  could  tell  how much Marc cherished her.
Taking a small step back to create a little space, she  nodded  toward  his  buzzing  phone."Marc,you should take that.It sounds important."

Marc  motioned  to  his  assistant,his  tone  clipped but firm."Look after her."

Having   served    Marc   for   years,the    assistant straightened  immediately and said,"Of course,Mr.
Curtis.You can count on me."

Noticing   they   still   had   more   to   discuss,Lottie quietly guided her team to one side,allowing them a moment of privacy.

Lisette    couldn't     help    exchanging    wide-eyed glances with her colleagues at the scene.Watching the tenderness between Marc and Marissa,she felt an    irresistible    urge    to    snap    a    photo;the atmosphere was soft and almost cinematic.

Once he finished giving directions to his assistant, Marc turned toward  Lottie  and  said,"I'm  counting on you for the rest."

"Got  it,Mr.Curtis,"Lottie  replied with a warm smile as she and the others watched him step  into  his Rolls Royce and drive away.
Leading   Marissa   deeper   into   the   studio,Lottie asked,"Do you already have something in mind,or should I go ahead with what I planned for today?"

She wanted to hear Marissa's preferences before starting,aware  that  she  couldn't  treat   her  like  a blank canvas and do whatever she pleased,as she did with her usual clients.

Earlier  that  day,a  makeup  artist  hired  by  Bryson had handled Marissa's bridal look—an expert who specialized  in  bridal  styles  but  leaned  toward  a heavier touch.

Evelina had slipped the artist a bribe,ensuring the makeup dulled Marissa's natural beauty by several degrees.Yet     even     buried     under     layers     of foundation   and   shadow,Marissa   still   outshone Holley,who  had  spent  hours  perfecting  her  own appearance.Her natural charm simply eclipsed it.

To  Lottie,that  kind  of  makeup   looked  excessive, though  she  worried   Marissa  might  actually  favor the  style.

"I'll   trust   your   judgment,"Marissa    said   calmly. Makeup wasn't something she  cared  much  about.

Most days,she didn't wear any at all,relying on her clear skin,full  brows,and  expressive eyes to carry her look-and they always did,no matter the style.

Lottie's face lit up with excitement as she snapped her   fingers,her   voice    brimming    with    energy. "Alright,team,let's  get  moving!"

"On  it!"

In   an   instant,the   assistants   gathered   around Marissa,fluttering about so quickly that she almost felt like a celebrity surrounded by flashing cameras.

Meanwhile,Marc's  assistant  found  himself  edged out  of  the  circle,standing  off  to  the  side  with nothing to do but wait and keep a watchful eye.

"Why  don't  you  take  a  seat  for  a  while?"Lisette suggested kindly,handing him a glass of water and nodding toward the sofa at the back.

He  gave  a  polite  shake  of  his  head."Thanks,but I'm fine standing."

Seeing that he meant it,Lisette let the matter drop, flashing  him  a  friendly   smile  before  turning  her attention back to her work.
###Chapter 67 She Didn't Want To Risk Offending  Her
Summer  was  a  season  of  relentless  sweat.Even Marissa,who     rarely     perspired,felt     the     heat. Wearing three layers left her feeling hot and sticky.

Lisette   and   the   other   assistants   watched   as Marissa removed one layer only to reveal another underneath.They  kept  their  expressions  neutral, careful not to offend her.
Marissa  must  have  her own  reasons for dressing that way.

Inside the room,the assistants pampered her with essential oils,their pleasant scent filling the air and making the room feel calm and relaxed.

Lottie was  outside  organizing  a  variety  of gowns and    accessories.instructing     her    assistant    to organize everything properly.

"Lottie,there's  a  call  for  you,"an  assistant  said, holding out a phone that had been ringing nonstop. She stood nervously at the edge of the room,afraid to step closer.
In sharp contrast to her customary friendliness with

clients,Lottie gave the assistant a chilly look as she
smoothed down the glittering hem of a dress. "Who's calling?"she asked.
With  stiff,anxious  shoulders,the  assistant  handed over the  phone."Three females.One  claims to  be from the Fletcher family,while the other two claim to  be  from  the  Hardy  family.They  said  they're coming  for  makeup  and  styling.I  told  them  you were unavailable today,but..."

"Didn't I say I was busy today?"Lottie interrupted, her tone sharp.

The  assistant  flinched,her  eyes  filling  with  tears. Her  lips  trembled   before  she   managed  to  say, "They didn't specifically ask for you."

Lottie's  expression  eased  slightly.She  picked  up the  phone,but  she  didn't  answer  right  away.She instructed,"Make sure someone waits at the door. Take  them  directly  to  the  third  floor  when  they arrive."
"Got  it,"the  assistant  replied  quickly  and  hurried off to follow the instruction.
On   the   second   floor,Lisette    and   the    other assistants  were  praising  Marissa."Miss,your  skin is so smooth,like a baby's."

Lisette took advantage of the oil massage to add a few extra gentle strokes.

Marissa,never  one  for  idle  talk,gave   her  a   brief glance but didn't respond.

"Lottie  must  be  so  jealous.You   know,right?Lottie isn't actually a woman but a man,"Lisette said.

Marissa's  cold  and  distant  demeanor  made  her difficult to approach.

Lisette    felt     slightly     offended     by     Marissa's indifference,thinking she  probably  looked down on ordinary people now that she was associated with the Curtis family.

Did  Marissa  even  realize  she  was  nothing  more than a plaything to Marc?

In  high  society,family  background  is  everything. Ordinary   young   women   are   often   treated   as disposable companions by wealthy men.

Unaware   of    Lisette's   thoughts,Marissa    simply nodded.
"Doesn't    it    bother    you?"Lisette    asked,curious. Some  people  still  couldn't  accept  Lottie's  gender transition,even though they respected her makeup skills.
"No,"Marissa   replied   evenly,lifting   her   gaze   to

meet  Lisette's.

Under the weight of that gaze,Lisette fell silent.

Marissa  picked  up  a  magazine,covered  her  face, and motioned for Lisette to continue.
Lisette   wanted   to   keep   talking,but   seeing Marissa's eyes drifting closed,she fell silent.

She didn't want to risk offending her.

The  Curtis  family was  known  for  being  generous. This single appointment was worth as much as all their orders from the previous month combined.

A soft knock sounded at the door.

Lisette carefully lifted the magazine from Marissa's face and noticed her even breathing.

She signaled for one of the assistants to open the door.
A   man   stood  outside,and  the  female  assistant quickly stepped out,closing the door behind her.

"What   is   it?"she   asked,recognizing   him  after  a second as  Marc's  assistant.Assuming  he was just checking  on  their  progress,she  said  politely,"Miss Fletcher is in the middle of a skincare session."

Marc's     assistant,Boden     Smith,replied,"Mr.Curtis asked me to bring over some ice cream for her."






Boden had originally planned to deliver the treats in person  but  thought  it  might  be  inappropriate  to enter,so he waited by the door.

The  assistant  was  surprised.After  a  brief  pause, she  decided  to  take  Boden  to  find  Lottie,only  to learn  that  she  wasn't  around.Another  colleague mentioned  that  Lottie  had  gone  up  to  the  third floor.

"Please wait  a  moment,"she  said  before  returning to  the  room.

Since  Lottie  was  absent,the  next  in  charge  was Lisette.
"Lisette!   Lisette!"   she   called  softly,  barely containing her excitement.Her eyes lit up with joy.
###Chapter 68 Mr.Curtis Is So Sweet To Her
At  once,Lisette   pressed  a  finger  to   her  lips,her eyebrows knitting together to silence the assistant.

Having  finished  her  skincare  routine,Marissa  had drifted into a deep sleep.

The  assistant  shot  a  glance  at   Marissa,swiftly clapped  a  hand  over  her  mouth,and  shared  a knowing  look  with  Lisette,hinting  at  a  noteworthy event.

Lisette   peered   at   Marissa,whose   breaths   were calm and even,then softly tiptoed out of the room.

The    moment    she    crossed    the    threshold,the assistant  could  barely  contain  her  glee,hopping twice   in   place,her   excitement   palpable."Lisette, Mr.Curtis sent  ice cream for everyone,courtesy of Miss Fletcher.Guess where it's from?"she chirped.

"Where?"Lisette  teased,fully  aware  it  wasn't  from some budget ice cream parlor,given the assistant's excitement.
"It's from  Gourmet  Glacier!"the  assistant  beamed, her grin contagious."I've never tried it before!"

"Really?"Lisette's    surprise     matched    hers.Was Marc genuinely that devoted to Marissa?

Her earlier wariness seemed justified.

"Where's  Lottie?"Lisette  asked.

"She's  handling  some  difficult  clients  on  the  third floor.Mr.Curtis'assistant    stopped     by    earlier,but  since  Miss   Fletcher  wasn't  changed,I  kept  him out,"the  assistant  replied,her  mind  fixated  on  the ice    cream,oblivious    to    her    oversight    in    not informing Marissa first.

"I'Il let her know,"Lisette decided after a moment's thought.

Since Marc had sent the treat in Marissa's name,it was only proper that she be informed.

For  Marissa,the  skincare  routine  felt  endless  and dull,so much so that she had dozed off.

Lisette stepped back in,debating whether to rouse her,when Marissa's stunning eyes fluttered open.

Those eyes were clear,luminous,and captivating.

Lisette,briefly   mesmerized,quickly   recovered   and smiled   warmly."Miss    Fletcher,your   skincare    is done.Would   you   like   to   rest   a   bit   longer?Mr. Curtis'assistant just  mentioned  he  sent  some  ice cream  for  everyone.Would  you   like  to   have   it

now?"

Lisette held out a pristine white robe,ready to slip it over Marissa as she rose.
Feeling   sticky   all   over,Marissa's   brow   creased slightly.

Lisette's pulse quickened.Then she heard Marissa say,"You all enjoy it.I need a shower first."

The heavy fragrance overwhelmed her;she craved the calming scent of herbs.

"Oh?"Lisette  blinked,caught  off  guard.

"I need to wash off,"Marissa clarified simply.

"Of  course,one  moment,"Lisette  replied,promptly fetching  fresh  undergarments  and  handing  them over."These are new,sent by Mrs.Curtis."

All   of    Corrine's   deliveries   matched   Marissa's measurements perfectly.

Marissa,clad only in underwear beneath the robe, headed to the shower."Call me when I'm done.Go enjoy the ice cream,"she said.

Lisette's   colleagues   grinned,delighted   even    by their client's small gesture.

They   giggled,thanking   Marissa."Thank   you,Miss Fletcher!"

"You're  welcome,"Marissa  replied,already  heading toward the shower.
"She  is  really  cold.You're  bold  to  chat  with  her, Lisette.Her stare  is  kind  of  intense,"one  coworker whispered."Mr.Curtis is so sweet to her!"

Lisette shot  her  a  look,not  calling  out  her  ulterior motives    but    choosing    sharp    words."Sure,Mr. Curtis  sent  the  treats,but  without   Miss  Fletcher, would he bother with our studio?Drop those fairy- tale    dreams.Real    life    isn't    a    soap     opera.
Understood?"

She fixed the woman with a pointed stare.

Unlike  Lottie,Lisette  had  a  keen  eye  for  motives. Despite  Lottie's  gender  transition,her   perspective often  leaned  traditionally  masculine,She understood exactly what the woman was thinking一 that   by   winning    Marc   over,she    could   live   a luxurious life like Marissa's.

The    woman,caught     in    Lisette's     gaze,ducked behind a coworker to avoid scrutiny.

Her colleague  promptly  stepped  away,leaving  her exposed,and   snapped,"Why    are   you   crowding me?"

Feeling  cornered,the  woman's  eyes  welled  up,but she stayed silent,too intimidated to respond.

Meanwhile,the  other  staff  clustered  together,their faces brightening the moment Lisette appeared.

Ignoring their  eager  looks,Lisette  made  a  beeline for Boden,who had just ended a call with Marc.
Aware  of  her  role  in  Marissa's  skincare   routine, Boden  stepped  forward  with  a  smile  and  asked, "Does Miss Fletcher have any instructions?"
###Chapter  69  Breathtaking



"Miss  Fletcher  said  we  could  enjoy  the  ice cream,"Lisette said,keeping  it  simple  and  to the  point.

"Alright,"Boden   replied.He   decided   not   to pry any further and stepped aside politely.

Lisette clapped her hands to get everyone's attention and announced with a bright smile, "Miss   Fletcher's   treating   everyone   to   ice cream!Let's split it up."

Makeup artists had a knack for turning even small  moments  into  cheerful  ones,and  right away,someone   jumped   in   to   help. Compliments  and  laughter  filled  the  air,the room buzzing with easy warmth.

From  his  spot  on  the  sofa,Boden  watched the scene unfold.

"Lisette,should  we  send  some   up  to  the third                 floor?"    someone             called             out

enthusiastically.

Lottie was still up there.


Since   Marissa   had   finished   her   skincare routine,it  seemed  about  time  to  call  Lottie down.

Lisette  paused  mid-bite  of  her   ice  cream, doing a quick mental calculation.

Marissa probably had ten minutes left in the bath.She turned to two assistants and said, "You two carry two boxes upstairs with me."

Then,after   a   moment's   thought,she changed   her   mind."Actually,you   two   take them up—I'll stay here."

She pulled out her phone and dialed Lottie's number,only   to   hear   a   ringtone   chiming nearby.Lisette    hung    up    just    as    Lottie appeared,her face clouded with irritation.

Lisette  quickly  filled  her  in  on  what  had happened      before      asking      gently,"Did something happen?"

Lottie's frown deepened as her eyes swept across the room.
"Want  some?"Lisette  offered,holding  out  a box of ice cream.
The first spoonful seemed to cool more than just  her  tongue—it  tempered  her  mood  a little too.Lottie set the  ice cream aside and asked,"Where's Miss Fletcher?"

"Upstairs,taking    a    bath,"Lisette    replied, grabbing another box of ice cream to bring along.

Their   timing   couldn't   have   been   better. Marissa had just finished her bath when they
reached the room.

Lottie immediately pulled out a chair for her. "Let's  start   on  your   hair.Are  you   hungry? Maybe a snack?"

She  motioned  for  one  of  the  assistants  to bring over a tray of bite-sized treats—just the right size to enjoy without ruining lipstick.

"Mr.Curtis  sent  over  the  ice  cream,"Lisette said with a pleasant smile,placing it next to the snacks.
"Thank you,"Marissa  said  softly.She  wasn't really   hungry   but   didn't   turn   down   the thoughtful  gesture.

"I'll just leave these here.Call me if you need anything.I'm    Lillie     Brewer,"the    assistant added,setting  the  tray  neatly  on  the  vanity before stepping back.

Marissa   looked   even    more   breathtaking before  the  makeup  than  after.Though  her features   radiated   confidence   and   charm, there was still a hint of youth about her—soft cheeks,a  touch  of  innocence  that  lingered beneath   her   poise.As   she   studied   her reflection,a  flicker  of  unfamiliarity  crossed her face.

The  mirrors  in  the  makeup  room  always seemed a little too kind,casting everyone in a gentler light.

The  woman  staring  back  at  her  was

flawlessly   composed,her   eyes   holding   a maturity and calmness rare for her age.

Her  gaze  was  cool,her  presence  distant— until,quite  suddenly  and  without  changing expression,Marissa     puffed     her     cheeks slightly.

Lottie,who   had   been   running   her   fingers absentmindedly    through    Marissa's    hair, caught sight of it and froze.

Oh,wow.So  adorable!

Who could possibly resist a woman as cool and composed as  Marissa suddenly  puffing out her cheeks like that?

Lottie  nearly  bounced on  her feet,unable to contain    her    delight.Her    smile    stretched wide,eyes curling into happy crescents.

Marissa,however,stayed      perfectly      calm, showing     not     the     slightest     hint     of embarrassment  at  being  caught  in  such  a playful  moment.

"Is  there  enough  time?"she  asked  with  a soft   sigh,her   clear   gaze   meeting   Lottie's through   the   mirror.The   question   snapped her back to reality.

Lottie     blinked,then     smiled     sheepishly. "Sorry.You're just so beautiful—I got lost for a moment."

Marissa's  lips  curved  into  a  brief,graceful smile."Then take a good look."

Before   Lottie   could  even  enjoy  that   rare warmth,the    smile    faded—Marissa's    face returning  to  its  usual  cool,unreadable  calm, as if wordlessly urging her to focus.

Lottie  pressed  her  lips  together  and  got  to work.

Marissa  cooperated  effortlessly,helping  the process move faster.

In less than  half an  hour,Lottie finished  her work.She   took   a   step   back,satisfied."All done."

Marissa lifted her gaze toward the mirror. Every eye in the room turned to her.
Marissa's  deep  curves  and  features  were already  remarkable.If  applied  poorly,heavy makeup might seem sloppy.

Many  believed  that  bold  features  called  for heavy  makeup—but  in  truth,a  lighter  touch revealed far more of her natural grace.

The woman in the mirror was breathtaking.

Her  eyes,now  framed   by  subtle  shadow, carried  a  quiet  mystery  that   drew  you   in without  effort.Her  high  nose  sat  in  perfect balance with the rest of her face,and her full red  lips  curved  ever  so   slightly,forming  a faint,magnetic   smile—one   that   was impossible to look away from.

Then she tilted her head.A single strand of  hair slipped free,brushing gently against her long   lashes,fluttering   in   the   air   as   she blinked.

An  assistant  reached  for  their  phone,eager to   capture   the   fleeting   perfection   of   that moment.

Lottie  was  the  first  to  snap  out  of  it.She clapped   her   hands   lightly,her  voice   brisk. "Alright,everyone—let's get the gowns."

Most  of  the  dresses  had  been  handpicked and sent by Corrine,all high-end pieces from top designers.

Still,Lottie  had  her  own  vision.She'd  gone the   extra   mile,contacting   a   few   designer friends   for   exclusive,unreleased   gowns一 unique    pieces    that    couldn't    be    found anywhere else.

They  had  cost  her  a  small  fortune,but  to Lottie,it was a worthy investment.
###Chapter 70 Why Haven't You Gone Back  To  Your  Parents
Once   her   makeup   and   hair   were   done, Marissa  excused  herself  to  the  restroom.A dull  ache stirred  in  her  abdomen,reminding her that her monthly cycle was close.

Heading back toward the dressing room,her phone  started  ringing.Lillian's  name  flashed on  the  screen,and  she  was  just  about  to

answer.

"Marissa?Why are you here?"

The  voice,sharp  and  edged  with   irritation, echoed from nearby.

"What's   the   matter?"Marissa   asked   while picking up the call,her eyes lifting toward the direction of the voice.

There    stood    Susanna    on    the    landing between   the   second   and   third   floors,her

expression a mix of surprise and disapproval. Evelina   stood   beside   her,looking   no   less unsettled.

Marissa's eyes  passed  briefly  over  Susanna before  settling  on  Evelina,whose  glare  was filled with open resentment.

"Let  Garry  know  I  won't  be  coming  tonight. And  wish  them  both  a  happy  birthday  for me,"Marissa    said    calmly,ending   the    call before turning away to leave.

"Don't   move   another   step!"Evelina's   voice rang out as she  hurried down the staircase, cutting  Marissa  off  just  before  she  reached the corner of the hall.

The  two  had  come  hoping  to  have  their makeup done by the famous Lottie,aiming to dazzle everyone at the evening's gathering.

Unfortunately,Lottie's      appointments     were packed,forcing    them    to    choose    another stylist recommended by the staff.

Jenna,a  frequent  visitor,wasn't  fond  of

Lottie  at  all.She  preferred  her  regular  artist and had already begun her session.

On  the  other  hand,Evelina  had  chosen  to wait.She overheard that  Lottie was  currently attending  to  the   lover   of  some   influential figure,and a plan began forming in her mind —to  persuade  that  woman  to  yield  a  bit  of Lottie's  time.

Everyone    in    their    circle     knew    Lottie's reputation.Her work was  quick  and  flawless, her hands capable of producing what others needed  hours to  perfect.

Neither  Evelina  nor  Susanna  had  imagined crossing paths with Marissa in this place.

What   on   earth  was   Marissa   doing   here? Could  it  be  that  she  had  also  come  for  a makeup session?

Then again..was it possible that she was the so-called     lover     of     that      influential     man      the staff had whispered about?



Evelina's eyes widened at the  idea,her  mind

reeling in disbelief.

No   matter  how  she  tried,envy  clung stubbornly to her thoughts.

If Marissa truly had become someone's lover, Evelina  hoped the  man was the worst sort imaginable—short,bald,with     a     protruding belly.

Susanna's  gaze   swept  over  Marissa  with thinly veiled scorn  before  her  voice  turned sharp."How  did  you  know  we  were  here? And  what  business  did  you  have  visiting Bryson  at  the  hospital  this  afternoon?He's Evelina's   husband   now.Do   you   have   no decency,trying to steal your sister's man?"

Stepping closer,Susanna positioned herself to block Marissa's path.

Not a flicker of emotion  crossed  Marissa's face.She   met   their   hostility   with   calm detachment,her eyes  briefly skimming over them before moving on,as though they were nothing more than strangers.

Susanna's     hand     shot     out,aiming    for Marissa's shoulder."Have you forgotten who raised you?You ungrateful child!"

Marissa tried to put distance between them, but Susanna trailed closely,her anger driving every step.

"Why   haven't   you   gone   back   to   your parents?What  are  you  still  doing  here  in Ozreka?Phil has already issued a statement. From this day forward,Evelina alone carries the Fletcher name.You're nothing now!Don't think I'll let you linger here!"

Evelina        misunderstood,also        believing Marissa had come to plead with them to let her   stay.She   slipped    her   hand    through Susanna's    arm,her    voice    dripping    with contempt."Considering  you  once  cared  for my  husband,I'll overlook your  pestering  him at the hospital.But don't think you can keep pretending to be a Fletcher."

Lifting   her   chin,Evelina   stared   down   at Marissa  as  if  gazing  at  something  beneath

her notice.

Without a flicker of emotion,Marissa met her glare,her   silence   sharp   enough   to   cut. Speaking  to   either   of  them,she   decided, would be no more useful than talking to the wind.
Still  fuming,Susanna  wasted  no  time  and dialed Phil's number to air her grievance.

The   moment   he   answered,she   said breathlessly,"Darling,you  won't   believe  this. We just bumped into Marissa at the makeup studio!"


Her words caught Phil completely off guard. For a moment,he stood frozen.

"Didn't  she  already  return  to  her  parents?" he asked,his voice edged with concern.
The  public  announcement  confirming Marissa's   true   identity   had   already   been released.He  feared  she  might  have  seen  it and was heartbroken.After all,they had cared for her for more than twenty  years,and  cutting  that  tie  wasn't  as simple as it sounded.

What  he  truly  wished  was  for  Marissa  to move  back  to  the  countryside,somewhere far from gossip and the reach of the internet —where time might dull her pain.

However,now,releasing that statement while she  was  still  around  felt  like  grinding  her pride into the dirt.

Because  of  Susanna's  insistence,the statement hadn't even referred to Marissa as their    adopted    daughter.Instead,it    coldly described  her  as  someone  who  had  been mistakenly  taken  into  the  family,as  though two decades of shared life meant absolutely nothing.

Like  a  fading  dream  at  dawn,those  years seemed to scatter,drifting away one by one like fallen leaves carried off by the wind.

I   doubt   she   ever   planned   on   leaving!" Susanna  sneered,switching   her  phone  to speaker mode,her eyes flashing with open contempt as they landed on Marissa.
###Chapter 71 Just Tell Me How Much You Need
Marissa looked at Susanna calmly, though her fingers twitched slightly as if she were holding something back.

"Life in the city has so much to offer. If she goes back to that small, quiet countryside, how could it ever compare to what she has here?" Susanna muttered bitterly. "I bet she turned around halfway and bribed one of our bodyguards to find out where we get our hair and makeup done.Typical of her."

Every thoughnt she had about Marissa was soaked in resentment. She twisted everything Marissa did into something vile.

Pure hatred contorted her features, her gaze casting Marissa as a monstrous villain.

"Listen, Bryson's already married to Evelina. Stop pestering him, or you'll regret it!" Susanna snapped,glancing around the hall, clearly ready to call someone over to throw Marissa out.

"Bryson? What's he got to do with this?" Phil's voice came through the phone, tight with worry.

He urged the driver to go faster, hoping to stop his wife and daughter before things got worse.

"She's got no shame!" Susanna barked, rolling her eyes before fixing Marissa with a cutting glare."She showed up at the hospital to throw herself at Bryson while Evelina was out getting his medicine! The nerve of her!"

She didn't hold back. She threw every cruel word she could think of, twisting the story into something far worse.

She wasn't about to let Phil fall for Marissa's teary act again. The last thing she wanted was for that girl to stay in their house, freeloading off them any longer. Phil sighed, trying to calm her down. "Just wait for me, alright? Don't overreact, and don't scare Marissa. We'll sort this out when I get there."

Phil had always been the calm one, unlike Susanna,who spoke without thinking. He preferred to handle things rationally.

"I don't care what you say, Phil. I just want her out of Ozreka for good!" Susanna snapped without hesitation.

"Give the phone to Marissa," Phil said firmly. "I'l talk to her myself. You and Evelina should go get your makeup done. You can't be late; it wouldn't look good."

Susanna looked ready to argue, but when she remembered how important the evening was, she gave in with visible irritation.

"Phil wants a word with you," she said coldly,shoving the phone toward Marissa. Then, turning to Evelina,her tone softened. "Sweetheart, go ahead and start your makeup. I'll be right there." Susanna wasn't comfortable with Phil speaking to Marissa alone.

Ever since finding out Marissa wasn't really her daughter, she couldn't stand the sight of her husband and Marissa together. It stirred something bitter in her every time.

They'd come down to have Lottie do their makeup,and now that they were there, Evelina didn't want to leave.

On top of that, Evelina couldn't shake thefeeling that Marissa's appearance wasn't a coincidence.

The makeup artists had been gossiping earlier about some rich man's lover, and Evelina had a sneaking suspicion that it was Marissa.

Seeing Marissa's flawless face, she understood why men were so drawn to her.

"Mom, I'll wait for Lottie," Evelina said, her eyes drifting to Marissa. The makeup on her face had Lottie's signature touch-soft blending, bold highlights. Curiosity slipped into her tone. "Marissa,did Lottie do your makeup?"

"Oh, please. She probably doesn't even know who Lottie is," Susanna sneered, her tone dripping with scorn.

When Marissa didn't reach for the phone, Susanna grew irritated. She thought Marissa was just being difficult. "Can't you hear me? I'm talking to you!Don't just stand there like a statue!"

"Do you really have to talk to her like that?" Phil's tone hardened on the other end of the line. In his mind, if Marissa hadn't gone with her birth parents,perhaps she could just stay in Ozreka.

Tonight's banquet would be full of influential people.He could use Marissa's beauty to lure in a powerful ally for the family business.

"You're always defending her!" Susanna hissed,clearly fed up. "She won't even talk to us, Phil!What's the point of humoring her? Don't tell me you're thinking about giving her money again!" After so many years together, Susanna knew her husband well enough, whenever he was cornered,he threw money at the problem.

If it were anyone else, she'd have let it go. But Marissa? Not a chance.

Deep down, Susanna wanted Marissa to end up miserable, living the same poor, hopeless life Evelina once had.

The idea hadn't even crossed Phil's mind until Susanna said it. After all, Marissa had called him "Dad" for more than twenty years, so it didn't feel right to just turn his back on her.

"Marissa, just tell me how much you need. I'll send it." His voice carried the same fatherly calm.

Marissa had never expected Susanna to turn so cold,so cruel, once their relationship fell apart.

She tried to act detached, but failed. A part of her still cared, no matter how hard she tried not to.

"Dad..." she began softly, unsure what to say. "Two hundred thousand," Phil offered before she could even respond, his tone decisive.
###Chapter 72 But That Won't Be Necessary
Marissa's voice was abruptly swallowed by the sudden rise in Phil's tone.

The words "two hundred thousand" rang sharply in her ears, snapping her back to clarity.

A faint, wry smile curved her lips.

She had been too naive.

How could she expect another person's parents to love her as their own?

Marissa lowered her gaze, concealing the storm behind her eyes. Her lashes trembled faintly before settling, and that faint curve of her mouth hardened into a cold, ironic smile.

She almost laughed. That amount couldn't even begin to cover the crises she had quietly fixed for the Fletcher Group, let alone the lavish gifts she'd sent over the years: Susanna's expensive jewelry, Phil's art pieces, or the designer clothes handpicked for Evelina.

All those gestures of goodwill suddenly felt absurd.

Marissa smiled bitterly at her own foolishness. When she didn't respond, Phil mistook her silence for sulking and tried to sound patient. "Marissa, you know the company's going through tough times right now..."

He was gearing up for another speech when Susanna abruptly cut in.

"Honey!" Her tone was sharp, her patience thin."She's going back to the countryside! She doesn't need all that money. Her real parents should be taking care of her! She's got nothing to do with us anymore!"

To Susanna,parting with two hundred thousand for Marissa was unbearable-especially for someone she  now saw as an outsider.

She didn't want to give it.

"Just give her twenty thousand," she huffed. "We've raised her all these years. I'm not even asking her to repay us. Isn't that generous enough?"
Phil, unable to signal her through the phone, tried to smooth things over. "Twenty thousand is toolittle!"

Marissa didn't miss the nuance. He wasn't defending her-he was defending the number. That was all she needed to understand.

No one in that family cared for her.Not really.

"A girl shouldn't be without money," Phil continued,putting on the voice of a kindly father. "Give her the two hundred thousand.Maybe she could start a small business back home. Things may be hard for us, but I can still manage two hundred thousand.Marissa,just take it."

Then, he addressed his wife. "Susanna, don't you have a card with that exact amount? Give it to Marissa."

"Thank you," Marissa replied, her tone polite yet distant. She turned her face slightly, a faint smile touching her lips. "But that won't be necessary."

Instinctively, Susanna clutched her designer bag closer, refusing to meet Marissa's gaze. Her lips twitched before she snapped, "That two hundred thousand was for Evelina's bracelet!"

Her voice was tight with frustration. The very idea of handing that money over to Marissa-money meant for her precious daughter-filled her with outrage.

Phil barked, "Why can't you just do as you're told?"

His voice came through the speaker, distorted and sharp, carrying a chill that made Susanna tense.

Phil was not a patient man at all. His carefully maintained image of refinement usually kept his temper in check, but Susanna-his wife-always knew how to strike that nerve.

Susanna was momentarily thrown off. "Hand the card to Marissa," Phil ordered coldly.

Still dazed, Susanna's hands moved on their own.She pulled the card from her handbag and thrust it out."Here."

When Marissa made no move to take it, Susanna's irritation flared. She stepped forward, intent on pressing it into her hand.

But Marissa quietly took three steps back, her gaze cool and unyielding as it lingered on the card.

"Marissa, just accept the card. Don't take what Susanna said to heart," Phil said, trying to ease the tension from the other end of the line.

Susanna snapped out of her thoughts when she saw Marissa's calm, unreadable face. Her own flushed red, a mix of embarrassment and irritation."|you don't want it, then fine," she said sharply. "I don't want to give you the money either."

Susanna was now seething with rage.

Being scolded by Phil-especially in front of Marissa -felt humiliating.

"I told you not to be so harsh with Marissa." Phil's tone dropped, his voice edged with restrained anger."Why do you always ignore what I say?"

Inside his luxury car, his expression was cold, his patience clearly worn thin. The tension in the air was sharper than the chill from the air conditioner.

The car pulled up in front of the private makeup studio. Phil stepped out, his assistant close behind,carrying a small safe.

The assistant stayed quiet, careful not to rub Phil the wrong way.

He followed carefully, praying the Fletcher family's drama wouldn't spill over onto him.
###Chapter 73 Why Should I Listen ToYou
Susanna stepped into the corridor with a face thatshowed clear irritation.
"Take it!"she barked,shoving the bank draft towardMarissa as if it were something filthy she couldn'tstand to hold.
Marissa stood there,unbothered,which only madeSusanna's fury burn hotter.Worried Phil might hearand scold her,Susanna quickly covered the receiverwith her hand,leaning in closer to hiss,"You'd bettertake the card and disappear!Don't think that justbecause my husband still shows you a bit ofkindness,you can use that to crawl back into theFletcher family.As long as I'm around,that will neverhappen."
Marissa glanced at her,but she said nothing.WhenSusanna raised her hand again,Marissa sidestepped effortlessly, and the bank card slipped from Susanna's fingers, landing on the floor with a soft clink.

"You dare refuse me?" Susanna snarled, her face contorted with fury.

She hadn't imagined Marissa would be this defiant,standing there in silence no matter what she threw at her.

Ending her call with Phil in a huff, she stormed toward Marissa. "Why are you still pestering us?" she shouted. "Our family owes you nothing! You've already found your real parents, so why can't you just stay with them? Why do you keep haunting us like this?"

Marissa, dressed elegantly in heels, didn't move an inch as Susanna tried to shoulder into her.

"Let me tell you something-Phil's affection won't get you back into this family! You'd better leave Ozreka now before I stop being nice!" "Then do it," Marissa replied flatly, her tone unbothered as she leaned lazily against the wall,glancing down at the fuming woman barely reaching her shoulder.

Susanna's phone started ringing again, the sound grating in her ears. "Who keeps calling me?" she snapped and rejected the call in frustration, too irritated to even glance at the screen.

"Just you wait!" she seethed, taking a few steps toward Marissa, only to stop short when she caught the chill in Marissa's eyes.

Flustered, Susanna quickly looked away and muttered under her breath, "You won't be staying here for long."

Pulling out her phone again, she called the Fletcher family's bodyguards.

"Get two people up to the second floor," she ordered, lifting her chin high as she shot Marissa a smug look, already picturing her being dragged out.But her triumphant look quickly faItered when she heard the response on the other end.

"What do you mean you're not allowed in? Are all bodyguards being stoppoed, or is it just ours?"

The Fletcher family's security had been stopped at the entrance of the makeup studio.

The call was filled with noise and overlapping voices,and unable to make sense of any of it, Susanna ended the call in frustration, her face dark with annoyance.

"Is anyone around?" she yelled, hoping someone would step in and kick Marissa out.

But luck wasn't on her side. The dressing room was packed with stylists and assistants rushing about, all too busy to pay attention to her tantrum.

The few who noticed from a distance quickly ducked out of sight, wanting no part in the drama.

After all, everyone here was either rich or connected,and the last thing they wanted was to meddle in someone else's dispute.A couple of them, however, recognized Marissa.They'd seen her arrive earier with Marc and quietly slipped away to inform their superior.

Evelina glanced around nervously, feeling a little embarrassed for Susanna but also relieved no one had come by.

"Listen, you'd better leave before | completely lose my temper!" Susanna barked, slamming the phone down and strutting as if she owned the world.

She was convinced Marissa had somehow sneaked in under the guise of the Fletcher family's daughter,and the idea made her bristle with contempt.

Marissa let out a humorless laugh.

At last, she saw Susanna for what she truly was-hypocritical, shameless, and inflated with self-importance.

Any prior respect she had for Susanna evaporated completely.

"You don't believe I'm serious?" Susanna's eyes locked onto Marissa's, a flicker of destructive malice in them as she noted the uncanny resemblance between Marissa and Phil's first love.

"Take that makeup off!" Susanna demanded,asserting the control she assumed she had over Marissa.

Marissa rarely used makeup. Years of Susanna's constant scolding had made going bare-faced second nature.

She had never questioned it until now.

"Why should I listen to you?" Marissa's gaze fell on Susanna again,disdain in her eyes.

Things had deteriorated so much that Susanna still expected her to obey, hoping to mold her into a perfect puppet.

Susanna, momentarily at a loss, replaced her anger with a sarcastic grin. "Now that you've caught the eye of a wealthy man, you think you can defy me?"

She fumed, her mind spinning. She couldn't fathom how Marissa could change so much. Surely that woman must have hooked some powerful man with her looks and charm.

Marissa would never have dared to talk to her like this before!

Marissa didn't bother denying it. "Well, being young and attractive, it's only natural that I catch the attention of certain men," she said coolly. Her gaze slid over Susanna and Evelina with a hint of mockery."As for you two... you're simply not capable."
###Chapter 74 How Dare You Raise Your Hand Against Evelina!
Susanna's face darkened with anger. She stood frozen, torn between the urge to slap Marissa and the instinct to cover Evelina's ears so she wouldn't hear such cutting words.

"Evelina, are you okay?" she asked, her voice tight with concern.

Evelina's expression was stiff as she stayed silent.

She hated being compared to Marissa-especially when it came to looks.

"What do you mean by that?" Evelina demanded, her brows knitting together. Her freshly manicured nails dug into her palm hard enough to draw a thin line of blood, but she didn't even flinch. Her gaze stayed fixed on Marissa.

Marissa knew exactly where to hit. After two years of living under the same roof, she was well aware of Evelina's biggest insecurity.

"What I mean is..." Marissa said slowly, each word deliberate, "not only will men not like you, you'll have to pay them to pretend they do."

Evelina froze, her disbelief almost visible. "Are you saying I'm ugly?" she asked, her voice trembling with restrained anger.

She had always thought Marissa had a sense of dignity-that Marissa wouldn't mock another woman's looks.

Clearly,she had been wrong.
Marissa arched a brow, her tone cool and dismissive."If that's how you choose to take it, I won't stop you."

"Take the card and leave!" Evelina snapped, her composure breaking. She bent down, grabbed the bank card from the floor, and held it out. She didn't care why Marissa was there anymore-she just wanted her gone. "Don't give it to her!" Susanna intercepted, snatching the card from Evelina's hand. "I'll handle this myself,"she said sharply, heading toward the front desk.There was no way she'd let Marissa linger here any longer.

"Apologize to me!" Evelina demanded, her voice rising. She wasn't someone who could let an insult go unanswered.

Marissa looked at her, lips curving into a faint,mocking smile. "Do you really think you deserve that?"

Evelina realized that Marissa was a different person.She grew more forceful and would not put up with any insults.

Evelina wasn't used to this side of Marissa. The calm,sharp-edged confidence unsettled her.

She preferred the old Marissa, the one who kept her head down, distant but harmless. This new version,with her cold tone and unshakable stare, made her uneasy. Evelina sneered, taking two steps forward. She raised her hand to slap Marissa. "What good is your pretty face? Bryson still doesn't want you! You are-"

Before she could finish, a sharp crack cut through the air.

"Did you just hit me?" Evelina stared at Marissa in disbelief, her voice shaking with rage. "How dare you!"

Marissa flexed her fingers, still feeling the sting of the slap.

She could never hit Susanna-no matter how harsh she was, Susanna had raised her for twenty years.

But Evelina? She meant nothing to her. Just an irritation Marissa had put up with for too long.

"Do I need your permission to hit you?" Marissa asked evenly. "I did it because I wanted to."

"Mom! Look at her!" Evelina burst into tears, turning to Susanna for help.  "Marissa!" Susanna's voice was sharp. "How dare you raise your hand against Evelina!"

Marissa tilted her head slightly. "Your bodyguards can't come in here, can they?" she said, a faint smile on her lips. "Tell me, is the Fletcher family only worth two hundred thousand?"

Susanna froze. "What do you mean by that?" she demanded. "What do you mean by that? What are you planning,Marissa?"

Her anger gave way to unease. For a moment, she forgot Evelina was crying beside her.

"Mom! She hit me! Are you just going to let her get away with that?" Evelina wailed, checking her reflection on her phone. A red mark stood out on her cheek. "I want to hit her back!"

Susanna hesitated, too slow to act.

Marissa moved first. She cauight Evelina's wrist and twisted it, her movement quick and firm.

"Ah!" Evelina cried out, collapsing to the floor. "Evelina!" Susanna reached for her but stumbled,falling beside her in shock.

"Evelina! Susanna!".

Phil's voice echoed down the hall. He rushed over and helped them up.

"How did you both fall?" Phil asked, his voice tight with concern as he looked at his wife and daughter.His gaze lingered on Evelina's scratched, bleeding palm, and his chest tightened.

Seeing him, Evelina's tears flowed even harder.The sting in her hand hurt more than her cheek, and she cried, voice trembling, "Dad, she slapped me for no reason-and even tried to hit Mom!"

Phil's frown deepened.

Marissa stood a few steps away, arms crossed,watching them with a calm,detached expression.

When Phil looked at her, he froze, Something about her face made his heart skip.B
the corridor lights, Marissa looked strikingly familiar

###Chapter 75 You've Confused Me With Someone Else
"Corrine, is that you?" Phil's voice wavered as the words slipped out, his trembling hand reaching forward, afraid that the face before him might dissolve like a mirage.

Corrine?

Marissa's brow furrowed slightly. Her eyes fixed on Phil, puzzled by the name that lingered between them.

It struck her as uncanny. Her mother shared that very name.

She and Evelina were switched at birth two decades ago.

Could it really have been just a simple error? Or had someone orchestrated it? Her features remained unreadable as Marissa met Phil's gaze, his expression overflowing with yearning.

At first sight, Marissa's refined makeup lent her an uncanny resemblance to Corrine-the same serene poise, the same quiet grace.

However, anyone who looked closer would see the distinction.

Where Corrine's allure carried the softness of spring air and the dignity of a noblewoman, Marissa's beauty gleamed with cool restraint, edged by quiet strength.

Unlike Corrine's gentle charm, Marissa's beauty struck sharply-breathtaking yet distant, a kind of loveliness that warned people not to draw too close.

Behind that glacial poise lay an honesty that didn't quite fit with her cold composure, the two sides of her at quiet war.

Phil, still clutching the hands of his wife and daughter, instinctively loosened his hold when Marissa's cold eyes met his. Lost in a haze of memories, he stumbled over his own defense."Corrine, please, I can explain-I never meant to..."

"Mr. Fletcher." Marissa's tone carried no warmth as her gaze met his. "You've confused me with someone else."

Wrong person?

A sharp tremor went through Phil's chest, the words snapping him out of the haze clouding his mind.

"What are you staring at, Phil?" Susanna's voice sliced through the tense air.

Rage burned hot beneath her skin.

She had predicted Phil would react this way the moment he saw Marissa in makeup, bearing a resemblance to his first love.

Men-they were all alike. Always chasing what wasn't theirs.

Susanna's sharp glare made Phil's shoulders stiffen. Avoiding her eyes, he bent slightly, pretending to dust off her sleeve as he muttered, "I only mistook her for someone else."

A bitter laugh escaped Susanna as she shoved Phil's hand aside.

Her voice rose, trembling with fury. "You called her Corrine! You still think about that woman, don't you?Look again, Phil! Just because Marissa looks a little like her, you lose all sense!"

Seizing Phil's collar, Susanna yanked him closer, her fury daring him to deny it.

Meanwhile, Phil's assistant stood frozen at the corner of the stairwell, not daring to move an inch or draw a single breath.

How did he always manage to find himself trapped in moments like this?

"I already said I mistook her for someone else!" Phil's tone was firm, though his eyes refused to meet Marissa's. "Still lying to me, even now! You've never forgotten her, have you?" Susanna's voice cracked with accusation, her fury unrelenting.

Phil caught her wrist, lowering it with quiet restraint.Straightening his collar, he met her glare without emotion and muttered, "If that's what you believe,then I have nothing more to say."

Susanna's cry rose to a shrill pitch, every word trembling with grief and rage. "You shut down the moment Corrine Curtis's name is mentioned!"

Corrine Curtis?

At that, Marissa's cold detachment faltered. That name-it was the same as her mother's.

Her eyes sharpened as she studied Susanna carefully.

"Enough," Phil muttered, drawing the trembling woman into his arms. "You're making a scene.Evelina's right here." Turning toward his daughter, he forced a calm smile. "Evelina, where did Marissa go?" Evelina stood frozen, her gaze fixed on the smear of blood pooling in her palm. For five long minutes, the message she sent Bryson-complete with a photo of
her injury-remained unread.

Phil spoke to her, but her mind was elsewhere.Without thinking, she hissed, "How should I know?I'm not her fucking keeper! Must I follow her every move?"

Marissa's attention drifted toward the pair, her curiosity faint but unmistakable.

Phil's face darkened with disbelief, startled that such rude words had come from his supposedly gentle daughter.

"Evelina?" Phil asked sharply, confusion lacing his tone.

"Huh? Dad?" Evelina blinked several times as if waking from a dream. Her lips curved into a practiced, sugary smile, her eyes wide with feigned innocence. Marissa almost let out a laugh.

What a convincing act.

Losing all interest, she turned her gaze elsewhere.

"Dad, is Mom alright? Did something happen to her?"Evelina's voice softened as if someone had flipped a switch, her demeanor transforming in an instant.

Phil lowered his gaze to Susanna, who had quieted in his arms, and gave a brief nod. "She's fine."

Phil then turned to Marissa. "Marissa, did I upset you somehow? You sound...distant."

His tone faltered as understanding dawned-he had mistaken Marissa for Corrine.

He hadn't expected her to address him so formally,as if they were strangers.

Nothing remained the same now; the girI who once sought his approval had changed beyond recognition.

A faint, knowing smile curved Marissa's lips as her sharp eyes met his. The look made him uneasy, as though she could see straight through the excuses he didn't voice.

"Do you have somewhere to stay if you're not going back to your parents?" Phil ventured after a moment."Come back for the night. I'll make sure someone drives you to your parents' residence tomorrow."

His words carried care, yet his eyes couldn't quite meet hers.

"Dad!" Evelina cut in. She didn't want Marissa setting foot in the Fletchers' house again. "Her real parents and fiancé are probably expecting her. Maybe the bodyguards could give her a ride to her parents'place later?"

That suggestion would make sure Marissa didn't find an excuse to turn back midway.

"What is it?" Phil's mind still fixed on Marissa. He didn't catch the meaning behind Evelina's words,assuming she only wanted to resume her preparations. His eyes drifted toward the staircase."Marcel."
###Chapter 76 We're Not Close


"Yes, Mr. Fletcher." Phil's assistant, Marcel Truman,appeared,peeking around the corner with a polite smile.

"Take Evelina to get her makeup done," Phil instructed, assuming she might feel timid and need someone to accompany her.

Marcel stepped closer, holding a small jewelry box,and offered a gentle smile. "Miss Fletcher."

From a distance, a voice called out, "Miss Fletcher, is everything alright?"

Evelina's eyes stayed glued to the jewelry box. When she heard the voice, she snapped instinctively,"Which Miss Fletcher are you talking to?"

After all, there were two Miss Fletchers present-herself and Marissa. Phil's gaze shifted just in time to see Lottie, striding confidently toward them in towering stilettos.

He raised a brow, inwardly questioning if all modern makeup artists had to adopt such a flamboyant appearance.

A wave of distaste washed over him, and he felt a strong urge to whisk his wife and daughters out of this private studio immediately.

Stepping forward, he positioned himself in front of his family, meeting Lottie's inquisitive gaze head-on.

"Do you know her?" Phil asked Marissa.

Evelina, feeling overlooked, flushed with annoyance.She pouted, giving Phil a pointed look, silently asking for reassurance.

Lottie's eyes landed on Marissa, partly hidden behind Phil, and her stern expression softened into a welcoming smile.

"Do you know these people, Miss Fletcher?" Lottie asked, slowing her steps, her eyes moving over Evelina and the woman Phil held close before resting on him.

Lottie recognized them as the mother-daughter duo who always insisted on her services, according to an assistant.

And Phil of the Fletcher Group? She had heard of him before.

It seemed Marissa was part of this family.

Could it be that the Curtis family was quietly negotiating a marriage alliance with them?

The thought made sense, though it was a matter they had kept tightly under wraps.

Lottie patiently waited for Marissa's reply, her face radiating a warmth and softness that Susanna had never witnessed in all her prior encounters.

What on earth was happening?

Susanna scrutinized Lottie's polite, almost deferential behavior, and was utterly shocked. Evelina was just as stunned.

She had recognized Lottie, the same artist who had once turned her and her mother away, claiming she was overbooked.

She wondered why Lottie was being so warm to Marissa.

"Oh, Lottie, you're here." Lisette hurried forward.She had just been told by an assistant that someone was causing trouble for Marissa in the corridor, and the thought of Marissa being cornered made her palms sweat. If anything happened to Marissa here, Marc would hold them accountable.

Taking a deep breath, Lisette pushed past the unfamiliar faces and greeted Marissa directly.

Phil, observing the scene with a skeptical squint,couldn't help but question the attitudes of those around them. He stepped forward, extending his hand to Lottie. "Hello, I'm Phil Fletcher," he introduced himself formally. "A pleasure, Mr. Fletcher," Lottie replied politely,shaking his hand with a courteous smile. "It's quite busy today. Please forgive us."

She spoke with grace, subtly studying Marissa's expression and letting out a small sigh of relief when she saw no hint of displeasure.

Phil returned her gesture with a nod. "It's alright," he said calmly.

"Miss Fletcher's session isn't finished yet. You might have to wait a little longer. I can have an assistant show you to the lounge if that's okay," Lottie suggested, waiting attentively for both Phil and Marissa to respond.

Marissa, however, stayed quietly to the side, showing no inclination to blend into the conversation.

Unable to discern her thoughts, Lottie turned to Lisette. "Lisette, please take Mr. Fletcher to the lounge."

Lisette, trained to follow instructions and maintain her professional composure, offered a smile. "Right this way, Mr. Fletcher."

Phil's frown deepened. He hesitated.

Turning her attention to Evelina and her mother,Lottie asked politely, though her tone seemed directed more toward Marissa's comfort than theirs,"Do you two still need your makeup done?"

Evelina's eyes brightened immediately. Lottie was rumored to work wonders with makeup, exactly why Evelina had come.

"Yes, I've been waiting for you," Evelina said happily,temporarily ignoring the soreness in her hands and face.

Lottie's eyes flickered to the prominent handprint on Evelina's face for a moment.Before she could reply,Marissa's voice cut in.

"| know them, but we're not close," she said,stepping away from Phil's protective presence.

At that, Lottie's eyes roamed over the group again,taking in the scene and sizing up the situation. When they landed on Evelina, a recent viral news story popped into her mind. The one about the Fletcher sisters fighting over a man, where the adopted daughter lost and was forced out of the family.

Could it have been Marissa who was cast aside?

Lottie's gaze flicked back and forth between Marissa and Evelina, and she shook her head quietly to herself. What a foolish man, she thought, to have made a decision so clearly wrong.

Between the Curtis and the Fletcher families, Lottie also understood which held more influence, but with Phil here and Marissa once being his daughter, she felt uncertain about her next move.

She was stuck having offered to arrange their makeup, but she had carefully avoided promising to do it herself.

"Lisette!" Lottie called, shooting her a meaningful glance. "Yes, Lottie," Lisette replied, turning to her, her face tight with tension.

"Hurry and assign someone to take these two ladies for their styling," Lottie instructed, leaving no room for hesitation.

"Right away." Lisette swiftly summoned a few assistants who had been standing by. "Over here!"

The assistants quickly moved in, gently escorting Evelina and her mother to the styling room upstairs.

Marcel, noticing the movement, hurried after them with the jewelry box, pausing to ask Phil, "Mr.Fletcher, may | accompany Mrs. Fletcher and Miss Fletcher?"
###Chapter 77 Let's Talk For A Bit


Phil waved his hand, signaling for his assistant to follow his wife and daughter.

"This way, Mr. Fletcher," Lisette said politely.

"Could we find a quiet place?" Phil asked in his usual composed manner, his tone warm yet commanding-the kind of confidence that came naturally to a man used to being respected.

Lisette glanced at Lottie, who gave a small nod.Turning back to Phil, she smiled quickly. "Of course,right this way."

"Marissa, let's talk for a bit, okay?" Phil said hopefully. He clearly wanted a moment alone with her.

Marissa's tone remained calm, her face expressionless. "Sorry, Mr. Fletcher, I have other commitments." There was nothing more to say between them.

Phil didn't seem offended. Instead, he gave a faint,indulgent smile.

"Didn't you once want to study medicine?" he said gently. "Tonight, I'll take you to meet Dr. Wallace."

The offer made her pause for a heartbeat.

She had wanted to study medicine. But Susanna and Phil had refused, insisting she major in business to prepare for managing the company. Her own dreams had never mattered.

Later, because of Bryson, she had secretly taken medical courses for two years.

So why bring it up now? Because of her looks?

Marissa's slender fingers brushed lightly over her cheek as she studied him in silence. Her face, calm and radiant, gave nothing away.

"There's no need," she said simply, then turned and walked away without hesitation. Phil watched her leave, shaking his head with a fond smile. "Her temper is getting worse," he muttered,half amused.

Lottie didn't respond. She had no intention of commenting on the Fletcher family's issues. Instead,she gave Lisette a subtle nod to change the subject."Mr. Fletcher," she said smoothly. "Would you like to sit down and rest for a bit? My assistant can help with that."

"Sure, thank you," Phil replied, following Lisette down the corridor.

Meanwhile, Marissa's makeup was finished-only her nails and jewelry remained.

She followed Lottie back to the dressing room.

The moment she opened the door, the air buzzed with chatter.

Evelina was standing in front of a mirror, surrounded by several staff members. One of them gushed, "You look stunning in that dress! Most people wear the dress, but you own it. So elegant!"

Across the room, Susanna was in her usual imperious form. She jabbed a finger toward the assistants managing the wardrobe. "I'm Marissa's mother. Why can't I use her dressing room? Go ahead-ask her if she dares to refuse me!"

The nearby assistants stood frozen, tense and uneasy, afraid Susanna might break the expensive jewelry in her hands.

Marissa walked straight over, her heels clicking against the floor.

"Miss Fletcher!" one of the assistants exclaimed in relief,quickly stepping forward.

Marissa's gaze swept over Susanna and Evelina,calm and cool, before resting on the assistant."What's going on?" she asked evenly. "Are there no other dressing rooms?"

Evelina, completely absorbed in herself, didn't even look up. She posed in the mirror, snapped a photo, and sent it off to Bryson, completely missing the fact that Marissa was visible in the shot. "What's the fuss? Can't you see I'm busy?" she said with a self-satisfied smile.

She didn't realize the voice was calling Marissa.

Susanna did. She clutched the necklace tigher,her brow creasing in irritation and confusion.

What was Phil doing?

Wasn't he supposed to talk to Marissa, to lecture her? Why was she back so soon?

With a sour expression, Susanna glared at Marissa's reflection in the mirror-radiant, composed, and clearly unbothered. The sight made her jaw tighten in frustration.

The assistant, feeling aggrieved, spoke up. "We were organising the dresses and jewelry when they came in, saying they needed this dressing room. I explained it was yours, but this lady said she was your mother and that-" "Shut up!" Susanna snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut through the air.

The assistant flinched but hurried on, words tumbling out."She said that you wouldn't dare refuse her the dressing room."

Marissa gave a composed nod. "That is accurate."

"Huh?" The assistant blinked, regretting herdecision to try to stop the mother and daughter.

Susanna froze for a second, then relaxed, misreading the situation completely. She assumed Phil had gotten through to Marissa, convinced her to behave.

Feeling smug, she straightened and sneered at the assistant. "See? She wouldn't even dare say no."

The assistant pressed her lips together, not daring to reply.

"Weren't you so confident before?" Susanna hissed,turning her attention back to Marissa. "Fetch Lottie.Evelina prefers her makeup style." Marissa moved forward, placing herself between Susanna and the assistant.

"lf Mrs. Corrine Curtis were here," she said evenly,"this dressing room would be hers to use as she pleases."
###Chapter 78 What Was Her Connection To Corrine
"Who did you just say?" Susanna's heart lurched at the name, her pulse stuttering as the necklace in her grasp slipped.

Susanna's eyes locked onto Marissa, whose features mirrored Corrine's, stirring a whirlwind of emotions within her.

The staff, fixated on Susanna's every move, gaped in stunned silence.

This set of jewelry was worth a city-center penthouse!

"Ah!"

Who let out that shriek?

Several employees clapped their hands over their mouths,exchanging bewildered glances. The young assistant yelped, diving forward.

Too far from Marissa, her desperate lunge couldn't save the ruby necklace from hitting the floor.

She crumpled to the floor, arm outstretched, eyes vacant with dread.

Hopelessness consumed her-how could she ever affordto cover the compensation?

A minute ticked by.

Marissa stayed silent, but Susanna couldn't hold back.

"What did you say? Corrine Curtis?" Her earlier joy morphed into doubt, then shock, and finally a frozen panic. Ignoring the ruby necklace at her feet, she stepped forward, accidentally nudging it aside.

Marissa knew Corrine? Who told her?

Could it be Phil?

"Say it again!" Susanna demanded through clenched teeth, questioning her own ears, needing confirmation.

How could Marissa know Corrine? Impossible!

She pinched herself, the sharp sting proving this wasn't a dream.

She really did hear Marissa mention Corrine's name.

What was her connection to Corrine?

Could Marissa be Phil and Corrine's daughter?

No way!

After securing her place, Susanna ensured they never crossed paths.

"Speak!" Her voice cracked with strain, her chest tight with unease.

"Corrine Curtis," Marissa answered abruptly, her eyes fixed on Susanna, anticipating a reaction.

As expected, Susanna's gaze sharpened with sudden clarity, her hands balling into fists, fingers digging into her palms. Thirty seconds ticked by. Then another minute.

"You know her? Where did you meet her? When?Why hide it from me?" Susanna's voice trembled with disbelief, a wave of insecurity eroding her composure.

If Marissa knew Corrine, had Phil met her too?

Were they hiding it from her?

Fury surged, her breath growing shallow and strained.

"And if I do, what then?" Marissa's gaze lifted,meeting Susanna's with a calm, steady clarity,her voice soft but unmistakable.

It seemed Susanna truly knew Corrine.

Susanna fell into a stunned silence.

"Ma'am, could you handle others' belongings with more care?" the young assistant murmured, hurrying to scoop the ruby necklace from the floor,inspecting it closely for damage.  Thankfully, the dressing room's padded floor,designed to prevent such mishaps, offered some safeguard.

The young assistant, unable to detect any obvious damage with a quick glance, exhaled in relief and looked up to find Lottie standing nearby, quiet but with a stern edge. She hurriedly brought the necklace to Marissa, drawn inexplicably to her commanding presence.

Despite the room's emotional chaos, Marissa exuded a calm authority, her serene demeanor easing the tension and making the atmosphere feel less heavy.

Lottie could sense the simmering conflict,clearly orchestrated by someone to bring these three women together.

A headache brewed-she would need to hold a meeting soon to reinforce team cohesion and weed out schemers, as manipulative staff were the last thing she needed.

With this in mind, she beckoned an assistant near Evelina, murmuring, "Are there no other dressing rooms available?"

Her real question was why Evelina and Susanna were brought here when they had been initially assigned to a room on the third floor.

Noticing Lottie's composed facade, the assistant tightened her lips and replied carefully, "All other rooms are full; this was the only one open, so we had no choice but to bring them here."

Her lowered gaze concealed a flicker of spite.Even as Marc's girlfriend, Marissa still had to share a dressing room with others.

Lottie's stare lingered, her frustration barely contained. "Figure out a solution when there isn't one. Is your brain just for decoration? Find another room!"

Her earlier softness evaporated, revealed as a facade.

"But no one wants to..." the assistant began. "Now!" Lottie's tone turned sharp.

"Okay," the assistant muttered.

Marissa's ties to the Curtis famnily demanded Lottie's respect. Turning to Evelina and Susanna, she said courteously, "Ladies, we've arranged another dressing room next door.Please follow me."
###Chapter 79 You Two Are A Match Made In Heaven
Susanna drifted deeper into her thoughts, unaware that Lottie had entered the room.

Evelina was texting Bryson, hoping he would come and fetch her. She wanted Marissa to witness how affectionate he could be.

The moment Lottie spoke, Evelina's fingers froze above the keyboard, and a chill flashed across her face. "| like this room!"

Lifting her chin stubbornly, she pointed toward Marissa. "Wy should I be the one to move? Tell Marissa to take the room next door instead."

Why was the demand made of her, and not Marissa?

After reading Bryson's message, Evelina's spirits lifted at once. "Marissa, Bryson's on his way to get me." She waved her phone proudly, showing off their chat right before Marissa's eyes.

She wanted to see if Marissa would still dare to act tough once Bryson arrived.

When he got there, she planned to tell him everything that had happened.

Marissa let out a light laugh and said, "And what's that supposed to mean?"

Bryson's arrival didn't concern her in the slightest.

Evelina's gaze brightened as she surveyed the room."Then you should be the one to move next door!"

There was no chance she would surrender all those pretty dresses and sparkling jewels to Marissa.

However, Evelina swiftly reconsidered. Bryson couldn't be allowed to lay eyes on Marissa. Men often cared too much about appearances, and though Evelina trusted Bryson's feelings, she couldn't take chances with temptation. "I'm done having you do my makeup. Take her next door instead. My mother and I will be staying here.Now call your artist and start on me already. I don't have time to waste!"

After clearing her thoughts, Evelina made up her mind to get Marissa out of the way.

Lottie, who was used to rejecting others herself,stiffened. It was the first time someone had spoken to her like that.

Although she had dealt with difficult people before,none had ever been this blind to the tension in the room.

Did Evelina ever stand a real chance of deciding for herself?

Lottie let out a mocking laugh. "Miss, I can't quite follow what you mean."

Misreading Lottie's sarcasm as sincerity, Evelina straightened up and said with effort, "Didn't you set up another room for makeup? Take her there, and we'll stay put until you return."

For a moment, Evelina faltered. Then she reconsidered, realizing she preferred Lottie's makeup work after all.

"Why would I?" Marissa said flatly. "Ever heard of first-come, first-served?"

Her glare lingered on Evelina's face, and her hands twitched as though itching to deliver another slap.

Earlier, Marissa's silence had fooled Evelina into thinking she'd backed down. But now, it was clear she was fighting back.

"So you're calling me ignorant?" Evelina said,planting her hands on her hips and pointing straight at her.

Of all insults, being labeled uneducated enraged her the most. It struck deeper than any comment about her looks.

Phil had once helped her get into a prestigious school, yet even that couldn't erase the shame of herpast-or her hatred of anyone who brought it up.

In the life she once lived, learning had never been a priority. Her family believed that girls had no need for schooling, and because of that, her lessons began years later than most children her age.

Without a word, Marissa cast her a fleeting look, her silence carrying a stubborn refusal to yield.

Watching the exchange, Lottie sighed and pressed her fingertips against her temple.

To her, Marissa seemed to be toying with Evelina and Susanna, spinning them around in her own little game.

"If that's how you see it, then so be it." Marissa lifted her shoulders in an effortless shrug, her voice calm and laced with indifference.

The urge to step in tugged at Lottie. She touched the bridge of her nose, torn between wanting to speak and not knowing how to begin.

"Miss Fletcher." The assistant approached cautiously, her gaze fixed on the glittering jewelry as though afraid it might vanish if she blinked. "Would you like me to store these for now?"'

Her chest tightened as she waited for an answer.With the air so thick with tension, leaving those valuables out in the open felt like inviting disaster.

One wrong word, she thought, and the women in front of her might just tear the room apart.

Disbelief flashed across Evelina's face as she spun toward the assistant. "Why on earth are you asking her?" Her hand shot up, finger quivering as she pointed at Marissa. "You mean to say all of this belongs to her?"

A quick nod came from the assistant. "Yes, Miss.Everything here is hers."

After all, those jewels were gifts meant for Marissa,sent personally by Corrine and Marc.

"That can't be right." Evelina's voice faltered, thick with disbelief.  None of it made sense.

How could Marissa possibly afford such things?Every cent she earned went toward Bryson's gifts or buying clothes and handbags for Evelina.

Gathering her skirt in one hand, Evelina stormed forward. "Tell me the truth. Did Bryson give you the money? Or was it Dad?"

As far as she knew, those two were the only men ever seen near Marissa.

Bryson? That stingy fool?

An eye roll nearly escaped Marissa, but she held it back as she sauntered to the vanity. Meeting Evelina's reflection in the mirror, she spoke with quiet mockery. "Do you honestly think I'm like you? Always begging men for money because you have nothing else to offer?"

A crease formed between Evelina's brows. "What did you just say?"

Repeating herself wasn't worth the effort. Marissa's lips lifted into a faint, teasing smile. "Tell me, why should I explain where my money comes from? Since when do I owe you answers?"

A gentle laugh slipped past her lips before she added, "Bryson? Please. You're the only one desperate enough to care about a man like him."

"Stop acting so bitter just because he doesn't want you!" Evelina snapped, planting her hands on her hips. A mocking smile curved her lips. "Someone like Bryson would never fall for a woman as impossible as you. He prefers gentle, considerate girls-like me!"

"Oh, is that so?" Marissa replied, her tone dripping with amusement. "Then I suppose I should congratulate you both. You two are a match made in heaven." She gave a slow, playful clap, the gesture more taunting than kind.

Evelina's face turned scarlet with rage."You-!"
###Chapter 80 This Is Marissa's Doing
"What?" Marissa looked at her, raising an eyebrow."I was giving you and Bryson my blessing."

Without another glance, she grabbed the ruby necklace from the assistant and tossed it into the jewelry box.

Her movements were rough, almost careless, and all the women watching fell silent.

A piece this expensive should have been handled carefully, shouldn't it?

Yet Marissa acted like she was just tossing around cheap trinkets from a sale bin.

Was she just careless, or did she really not care?

Everyone was quietly wondering.

Evelina frowned, irritated by Marissa's casual tone."Who even asked for your blessings?" she muttered. Her eyes lingered on the ruby set, hoping, perhaps irrationally, that Marissa might show some softness.

In the past, Marissa would have handed them over without a second thought; she had never been sentimental about such items.

But now, things had changed.

"Pack them up," Marissa told the assistant calmly.

These were meaningful gifts from Corrine and Marc,and she wasn't about to let anyone mishandle them.

"Why are you putting them away? I haven't picked anything yet!" Evelina protested, spreading her arms to shield the jewelry. "I know her, and there's no way these belong to her! Leave them here!"

Evelina knew Marissa had almost no money left, and her accounts were nearly empty, leaving her only a few thousand at best.

"What do you know about me, huh?" Marissa asked,leaning back a little. She herself was still figuring out her real background,So why did Evelina presume to understand her so completely?

Evelina gave her a sharp look. "Your parents are laboring on some countryside farm. How on earth could you afford all this? It makes no sense!"

Her eyes widened as if she'd just had a sudden realization. "You're not some rich man's secret lover,are you?"

A kept woman, a hidden affair... it fit perfectly with Evelina's assumptions.

After all, which rich man didn't already have a wife at home?

Evelina started making up more stories. "You act all innocent around those men, but you've got them under your spell, don't you? These are gifts from your admirers, right? It's unbelievable that you're broke and yet you've got men lining up to pay for you and let you show off all this in front of everyone!" "And what's that got to do with you?" Marissa said casually, adjusting her hand to land another slap on Evelina's face.

"It's got everything to do with me!" Evelina retorted,hands on her hips. "The money you're flaunting?That belongs to me,you-"

Before she could finish, a sharp smack sent Evelina tumbling to the floor.

She'd been babbling nonsense, and Marissa had had enough.

Marissa flexed her left hand, still feeling the sting of the impact.

Then she inspected Evelina's face-the fresh slap mark was perfectly symmetrical to the previous one.

Without a word, she bent down, hoisted Evelina off the floor like she weighed nothing, and marched straight toward the door, ignoring everyone else in the dressing room.

Oh wow. Marissa's composure and precision left everyone in awe.

Just moments ago, she had seemed calm and indifferent, but now? She was taking real action,moving decisively.

Incredible.

Even the assistants watching had their eyes sparkling with admiration.

"Marissa!" Susanna snapped back to reality at the commotion. Seeing Evelina being dragged around like a rag doll, her anger boiled over. She grabbed a small wooden stool, ready to hurl it at Marissa.

"Careful!" one of the assistants yelled sharply.

Reacting instantly, Marissa twisted to evade and instinctively raised her arm.

Evelina, in Marissa's grip, became an unwitting shield, perfectly blocking the flying stool.

The stool hit Evelina's forehead with a heavy thump.

Then it clattered to the floor, and Evelina went limp, her forehead swelling as blood trickled down.

Everyone present froze in shock.

No one could grasp how quickly the argument had turned into a full-blown fight.

It had been two against one, and yet they were the ones losing.

Calm as ever, Marissa tossed Evelina toward Susanna like a rag doll. "You knocked her out," she said flatly.

"How can you be so heartless? She's your sister!"
Susanna gasped, staring at her daughter's swollen,
bleeding face, feeling her heart shatter.

She almost collapsed from grief. Luckily, a staff member steadied her, asking anxiously, "Ma'am, are you alright?"

"Get my husband, now!" Susanna ignored Marissa entirely, kneeling beside Evelina and shaking her gently. "Evelina, wake up!"

The staff scrambled to fetch Phil immediately. "Marissa, what happened?" Phil demanded the moment he arrived, finding Susanna crying and glaring at Marissa with pure resentment.

"She hit Evelina again! Look at her face!" Susanna cried, lifting Evelina's head to show Phil the bruises."This is MAarissa's doing!"

Phil's eyes widened. He couldn't believe it. Marissa had never struck anyone in front of him.

"Is this true?" he asked cautiously.

Susanna grabbed his collar, shaking him slightly, her anger so intense it was frightening. "Look at Evelina!Can't you see what Marissa has done?"
###Chapter 81I Have Been An UnfitFather
Phil's eyes followed Susanna's stare to the floor.Holy cow!
If Susanna hadn't been standing right there,Philwould've never guessed the crumpled figure wasEvelina.
"Marissa,did you really do this?"Phil's face turnedhard as stone,his voice sharp.
"No way."Marissa jabbed a finger toward Susanna,then at Evelina sprawled out."She's the one whoclocked Evelina with a stool."
She'd only meant to kick Evelina out,not knock herlights out.
"This is on you!If you hadn't used her as a humanshield,I wouldn't have hit Evelina,you snake!" Susanna spat.

With Phil in her corner, she shot up, claws out,itching to scratch Marissa's face.

She loathed that face with every fiber of her being.

"You heard her, right? I'm in the clear." Marissa locked eyes with Phil, not bothering to explain further.

Phil's temple pulsed like a ticking bomb. He grabbed Susanna, barking, "Enough! We need to get Evelina to a hospital."

They couldn't afford to miss tonight's banquet!

If Evelina couldn't make it... Phil's gaze swung back to Marissa.

"Marcel, get them to the hospital." Phil made the call,quick and firm.

What?

Marcel looked up, totally thrown. Dealing with Susanna was way above his pay grade. But he just nodded, flashing a practiced smile. "Got it,Mr.Fletcher."
"You're not coming?"Susanna's voice was ice,hereyes narrowing at Phil.
"I've got business to handle."Phil's tone was clipped,patience wearing thin."Don't make a scene!"
Was he seriously raising his voice at her?
Phil's attitude hit Susanna like a slap,and she wasready to blow.Ignoring everyone else,she yelled,"Evelina's hurt,and you don't give a damn?"
This woman was impossible!
Phil's eyes flickered with restraint.He took a deepbreath,softening his voice."Go on ahead.I'll bethere soon."
"No chance!"Susanna wasn't buying it.She glared 'I'll call you later."
His bossy tone rubbed Marissa the wrong way.

She raised an eyebrow, not in the mood to play along. She sized Phil up. "Don't bother."

Were they here to prep for the Curtis family's banquet?

Marissa crossed her arms, a spark of curiosity flaring. She couldn't wait to see their faces when they ran into her at the party.

After a quick thought, she offered, "How about I try acupuncture on her?"

"Since when do you know that?" Phil's eyes narrowed,skepticism all over his face.

He didn't recall anyone mentioning this about Marissa.

Phil felt like he was losing his grip on her, bit by bit.

He wanted to dig deeper, but not with all these people around.

"Why's that your business?" Marissa's words were sharp,no trace of warmth for Phil.
"Marissa!"Phil's temper flared."I'm your father!"
Susanna was about to pile on,but Phil shot her a lookcold enough to freeze,clearly done with hernonsense.
"Then how come you know so little about me?"Marissa fired back,her voice dripping with disdain.
Twenty years under the same roof,and he nevereven knew she studied medicine.And he had thenerve to call himself her father.
That was laughable.
Phil was left speechless.
He had to admit—he'd never really paid muchattention to Marissa before.Work always came first.Still,she was his daughter.Shouldn't she be moreopen with him?
His tone was deeply remorseful."I apologize.I havebeen an unfit father." Phil could be pragmatic when he wanted to be,setting aside his pride with ease.
It was,in truith,a smart move.
People were used to seeing domineering parents.Areasonable one—especially a father who apologizedto his daughter—was rare.
It was a clever move on Phil's part.
Marissa,however,remained unmoved.She clickedher tongue softly,unimpressed.
If she hadn't seen firsthand how he treated Evelina,she might've bought the idea that all dads kept theirdaughters at arm's length. Phil had never been fair to her,and now he wasputting on this fake loving-dad act,
"Quit yapping and get Evelina to the hospitalalready!"Susanna snapped,her nerves frayed.Shewas terrified Evelina's head injury was worse than itlooked,and Phil's focus on anything else made herwant to tear into him.
"Wanna come along?" Phil crouched down, scooping up Evelina's frame like it was nothing, thanks to his gym habit.

"No way," Marissa shot back, not even bothering with an excuse.

Phil blinked, caught off guard by her defiance.He wasn't used to Marissa pushing back like that.

"Behave yourself," he coaxed, his voice syrupy sweet.

That tone-it made her skin crawl.

Did he think she was someone else? Her birth mom,maybe?

Marissa's face darkened, and she fired back, "Mr.Fletcher, watch how you talk to me."

Susanna's expression wasn't any better.

She'd always thought Marissa was a spitting image of Phil's old flame, Corrine. She wanted to sling a few sharp words but bit her tongue, worried that if Phil realized Marissa knew about Corrine, it'd stir up a hornet's nest.

Susanna wasn't dense-far from it. Her quick thinking had dodged plenty of trouble before.Especially when things smelled like bad news,her gut kicked in to steer her clear.

She pressed her lips together, scheming on how to keep Phil from showing up at the Curtis family's bash tonight.

Something in her gut twisted, a nagging feeling that something bad was brewing at that party.

Susanna's chest tightened, like the air itself was suffocating her.
###Chapter 82 Theodore Comes To Pick Her Up
Nobody showed concern for Susanna's emotions.

Marcel quietly retrieved Evelina's phone from where she had left it and noticed the caller's ID. Before he could ask about it, the call had already disconnected.

Evelina's situation was deteriorating, and Phil couldn't afford to waste any more time.

"Why are you so eager to challenge me today,Marissa?" Phil pressed, trying to soften her. Though not an exemplary father, he understood her temperament well.

He recognized that beneath her tough exterior,Marissa was tender-hearted.

Regardless of how others treated her, a small gesture of kindness would win her trust completely. "I'm sorry for what happened before,"Phil saidearnestly,his typically scheming eyes now brimmingwith sincere remorse."How about this?Come withme to the hospital,and I'll clarify everything on theway."
His motives were transparent.
Since Evelina couldn't attend the event,he wantedMarissa to take her place.
Marissa shot him a cold,piercing look."You'vealready made your decisions,so stop actingremorseful—it is repulsive."
Phil's chest heaved with frustration,nearlybreathless."Is that truly how you see me?"
"Isn't it?"Marissa retorted sharply,her voicemeasured yet cutting.
She wasn't oblivious;she had simply chosen not tocall it out before.
"Marissa..."Phil exhaled,pausing as if overwhelmedwith words but unsure where to start. His tone softened with each attempt. "Are you really not coming?"

Marissa clicked her tongue in dismissal. She had no intention of going.

Seeing her defiance, Phil's spirits sank. In just half a day, he had lost his influence over her.

Feeling powerless, he sighed. Unable to sway Marissa and preoccupied with holding Evelina,he couldn't force Marissa to come along.

Glancing at Marcel, who was frail and clearly unfit for the task, he summoned the bodyguards instead.

Before departing, he recalled something.

"Marissa, take this bank card." After handing Evelina to the guards, Phil pulled a secondary bank card from his wallet, offering it to Marissa.

She dodged it. Did she need the two hundred thousand? Absolutely not.

"Marissa, why are you so stubborn?" Phil sighed,his  eyes shifting to the man beside her. Unable to resist,he asked, "Is this your boyfriend?"

Boden remained silent, offering only a faint smile.

Marissa gave Boden a pointed glance but didn't reply, turning her focus to the makeup mirror.

"I need to get back to work," Lottie said with a polite smile, apologizing to Phil. Seeing her studio wasn't entangled in the drama, she opted to finish her tasks first.

Realizing he couldn't change Marissa's mind and wary of more delays, Phil left with a heavy expression.

After finishing her styling, Marissa stepped downstairs and found Theodore there.

Now dressed in formal attire, he looked more strikingly handsome.

Leaning against the door, Marissa admired him briefly, her eyes gleaming with appreciation for his looks. Sensing someone's gaze, Theodore's brow furrowed slightly. Upon seeing it was Marissa, his expression softened.

At that moment, Marissa radiated a captivating allure,entirely transformed.

Theodore's eyes lingered on her face before he averted his gaze. "Let's go."

His manner stayed consistent despite his softened expression. He retained a distant air, though less icy when facing Marissa.

She didn't question why Theodore had replaced Marc as her escort.

When he suggested they leave, he didn't move immediately, waiting for her to approach and link arms.

Marissa tilted her head, a rare playful innocence in her expression. "Link arms?"

"Are you against it?" Theodore's voice, cool as ever,carried its usual pleasing tone. "No," Marissa replied smoothly, reaching for his arm As she moved to slip her hand through, he shifted slightly.

She paused, glancing at the hand now extended before her.

Theodore looked at her, nudging his hand closer in silent encouragement.

Marissa placed her hand in his, lifting her gaze with a soft smile, her dimples faintly visible.

For a moment, Theodore's lips curved subtly. He glanced down at their hands-one large, one delicate.

Her slender fingers rested softly in his palm, and he gently closed his hand around hers.

Marissa's eyes traced his perfect features, her satisfaction growing. Her thumb brushed lightly against his palm, teasingly.

"What's wrong?" Theodore turned to her, his dark eyes reflecting her calm, compliant demeanor. But was she truly so docile?

Marissa felt a wave of intensity. His face was so close their noses nearly brushed, their breaths mingling.Their eyes drifted to each other's lips.

Theodore's throat moved slightly, his gaze fixed on her glossy red lips. He couldn't deny her allure, nor did he want to resist it.

Her skin glowed under the light, utterly captivating.

His eyes lingered on her graceful neck, resisting the urge to look further.

For Marissa, it was her first time being so near a man.Their locked gazes and shared breaths felt like an intimate, lingering kiss. Her strength seemed to drain away, and her legs began to grow weak.
###Chapter 83 Attraction


The air between Marissa and Theodore was thick with unspoken intimacy, their eyes locked as if a single moment alone would be all it took to ignite their passion.

The next second, they forced themselves to look away.

What seemed like an eternity of eye contact lasted only a few seconds, yet in that brief span, a quiet storm stirred between them-an unspoken pull charged with emotion and tension that no one else could sense.

Both felt it at once, that sudden, magnetic spark neither could ignore.

Marissa flushed deeply, not just across her cheeks but down her neck as well. Her usual calmness slipped, replaced by an unfamiliar glow that made her look soft er, more alluring. She, however, didn't notice the shift at all. Heat spread across her face, her heartbeat thudding a little faster, yet she thought she still appeared calm.

Theodore, on the other hand, betrayed nothing on the surface. His expression remained serious, almost calculating, yet underneath, his mind was a storm of thought and feeling, battling to suppress the sudden pull toward her.

Though neither had touched a drop of alcohol,Marissa felt a heady lightness.

Theodore's stern, commanding presence filled the air, yet there was an unexpected charm in the way he carried himself.

She swallowed hard, her eyes refusing to leave his face.

He was everything she found attractive-handsome,effortlessly put-together, with those defined features and slightly tousled hair that made him look naturally confident. The glasses gave him a polished edge,while the faint curve of his lips... Wait,was that a smile?

Startled by her own observation, Marissa blinked and instinctively asked, "What are you staring at?"

Theodore's answer came without hesitation, steady and unapologetic. "You."

The word hit harder than Marissa expected. She was used to people hiding behind politeness or vague charm, so this man's bluntness left her momentarily speechless. When she finally managed to respond,her words came out softer than intended. "Do you like what you see?"

As soon as she heard herself, she wanted to take it back.

Why did her voice sound so flirtatious?

That wasn't like her at all. Theodore's mouth twitched, almost forming a smile as his eyes wandered back to her face. His heart thumped wildly in his chest, no matter how calm he tried to look.

When he stayed silent, Marissa bit her lip,uncertain of what to think. Feeling awkward, she waved a hand in front of him, her tone cooling again. "What's wrong with you?" she asked, her eyes showing just a trace of worry.

"Nothing," he said quietly, shaking his head.

His face looked perfectly composed, but inside, his thoughts were anything but peaceful. In that instant,he caught himself imagining... a future, a lifetime shared with her.

Theodore shut his eyes briefly, his Adam's apple shifting as he swallowed, trying to regain control.

Marissa, puzzled by his reaction, found herself staring at his throat, oddly tempted to brush her fingers over the curve of his Adam's apple.

Catching herself, she drew in a quiet breath and took a small step back, putting a bit of space between them.Forcing her composure, she murmured, "Shall we go?"

"Sure," he replied simply. Without another word, they started down the stairs side by side.

Boden and Wilbur followed behind, both pulling out their phones to snap a few photos. When they were done, they looked at each other and grinned knowingly.

Outside the private studio, a swarm of reporters waited eagerly, their cameras flashing nonstop at the sight of the door opening.

Marissa, however, was struggling in silence. She had never worn high heels before, and each step in the eight-centimeter stilettos felt like walking a tightrope.

At first, she managed to keep up with Theodore's long strides, but by the time they stepped out of the elevator and into the lobby, he was practically pulling her along.

Even the strongest woman had her weak spots, and for Marissa, it was clearly the heels.

Feeling a tug at his arm, Theodore glanced back, immediately noticing her strained expression.

"You alright?" he asked, his deep voice carrying genuine concern.

Marissa bent slightly, rubbing her calf while offering a small, embarrassed smile. "I'm just... not used to wearing heels," she admitted.

"Mind if I take a look at your ankles?" Theodore asked,his steady gaze fixed on her face as he waited for permission.

Marissa's dress was light and delicate, the thin straps draping gently over her shoulders and exposing smooth skin beneath. The fabric shimmered softly under the light, hugging her figure in all the right places.

Every small movement she made seemed effortlessly elegant, captivating in its simplicity.

Her long, toned legs looked even more striking in the heels, the asymmetrical hem of her dress-shorter in front, longer behind-giving her an almost otherworldly allure.But Theodore's sharp mindregistered a small problem.If he crouched down tocheck and she wasn't wearing safety shorts,thingscould turn awkward quickly.
Dresses like this were meant for visual effect,oftenpaired with seamless undergarments for a perfectsilhouette.
Theodore stayed perfectly composed,his earlierintensity replaced by a calm expression.
His level of self-control was impressive,somethingMarissa couldn't help but quietly admire.
After a brief pause,she finally shook her head andsaid softly,"I don't mind."
###Chapter 84 Do You Enjoy It


Theodore didn't waste another breath. He simply dropped to a crouch right there in front of Marissa.

They were practically nose-to-knee, close enough that his warm breath kept grazing her leg everySo often.

Marissa couldn't pin down whether the air conditioning in the hall was running on fumes or if she was just getting flustered, but her ears were turning a telltale shade of pink.

When she instinctively tried to take a step back,she felt the warmth of his fingertips brush against her ankle. His voice came out a touch rough around the edges."It's red."

Marissa had already told him it was no big deal. She found herself backed into a corner-she couldn't very well turn him down again. She hesitated mid-step as she retreated, then went still. Her thoughts were running in circles, and she barely registered what had come out of his mouth, her eyes settling on his hair instead.

She'd been staring at Theodore long enough to make it look like she was about to say something.

Theodore seemed to have mumbled something,then stopped short, pulling his gaze away from her ankle to look up at her instead.

Her right heel had taken a beating from her new high heels, rubbed raw and angry, while her left heel was only showing a bit of redness-nothing that broke through the skin.

Marissa's skin was paper-thin, and she felt pain like nobody's business. What would barely register as a twinge for most people hit her like a freight train.
Back in the day, she'd sat on the fence for over half a year before finally pulling the trigger on going to the beauty salon to erase the burn scar on her hand.

In the end, it was a stupid move-all it did was hand Evelina the credit for taking care of Bryson.

The thought of Bryson brought a wave of disappointment crashing over Marissa, though if she was being honest, she'd seen it coming from a mile away.

That man had a real talent for spinning her fairy tales,each one more far-fetched than the last.

"Come again?" Marissa was off in her own world,looking for all the world like she was hanging on Theodore's every word, though her mind was a million miles away.

When she came back down to earth, her hands were planted on Theodore's head, and his carefully styled hair was now a disaster zone thanks to her wandering fingers.

Theodore stayed put in his crouch, letting her have her way with him.

Her hands froze, and she glanced down at Theodore,then at her own hands-which had clearly overstepped-and felt completely thrown for a loop.

If she played it off like her hands had a mind of their own and she bore no responsibility whatsoever,would Theodore buy it?

"Um, what were you saying just now?" Marissa asked, tripping over her words as she tried to slip her hands back without drawing attention. She hadn't counted on his hair being so soft and downright pleasant to run her fingers through.

The corner of her mouth twitched upward in quiet satisfaction at the feel of it. But then reality kicked in -she couldn't keep indulging-and her expression took a nosedive for just a moment, betraying a flicker of regret at having to stop.

"Do you enjoy it?" Theodore's voice drifted into her ear.

He stayed in his crouch, looking completely at ease,his hand resting casually on the sofa right beside Marissa's thigh-basically camping out in her personal bubble. Marissa didn't catch his teasing tone. She figured Theodore was taking a jab at her.

Not about to let herself look like the one who blinked first under his somewhat loaded stare, she boldly reached out again, her slender fingers weaving through his soft hair and giving it another good muss.

The more she went at it, the more her expression evened out, eventually settling into a look of complete nonchalance-as if she saw no wrong in her actions whatsoever.

Theodore made no move to stop her, his silence a quiet acceptance of her touch.

He dipped his head slightly, playing the part of a loyal knight kneeling before his queen.

"I do enjoy it." Marissa let out a soft laugh, her eyes sparkling as they caught his striking face.
"Glad to know that," Theodore replied, the ghost of a smile playing on his lips, his tone filled with sincerity.Right then, Wilbur stood about a meter off, his voice carrying a note of seriousness. "Mr. Brooks, the internet's gone wild with gossip about Miss Curtis and her brother. Reporters are swarming like bees,and the makeup studio entrance is completely gridlocked. The police are working on clearing a path -it should take about ten minutes."

The original plan had Marc picking her up himself.But once word of the online rumors reached Theodore's ears, he bumped a meeting to come get Marissa in person.

When they'd left the company, things hadn't blown up to this degree yet, and there was no tale of Marissa clocking Evelina out of jealousy and landing her in the hospital.

Yet somehow, in a flat forty minutes, these stories had rocketed into the top three trending topics.

It was crystal clear someone was pulling strings behind the curtain to paint a target on Marissa's back. Back when it first hit, this whole mess had kicked up quite the storm, with ridiculous titles like "Sisters Go Head-to-Head Over the Same Man" climbing the trending charts.

With a fiancé as exceptional as Theodore in her corner, how could Marissa possibly have eyes for Bryson?

In Wilbur's eyes, Bryson had no redeeming qualities.

Though Wilbur's face was a blank slate, his mind was running a marathon.

At the revelation, Marissa pulled her hand back,shifting slightly to fish her phone out of her handbag.

Hearing all this, Theodore rose to his feet without missing a beat, running a hand through his hair to put it back in order.

He shot a glance at Wilbur, not remotely fazed about being caught with Marissa's fingers tangled in his hair. Cool as a cucumber, he directed, "Have someone bring over a pair of flats." Theodore was finally learning to care for his fiancée!

Wilbur felt a surge of excitement, barely keeping a lid on his shock as he responded promptly, "Will do."

"If they're killing you, don't wear them. No sense in putting yourself through the wringer," Theodore said,turning his attention back to Marissa.

When they'd crossed paths before, her shoes-though high-heeled-weren't stilettos and didn't look like they were giving her such grief.

Marissa had no clue what was running through his head. If she had, she would've set the record straight that her wedding shoes were custom-made by a friend.
###Chapter 85 She Found No DiscomfortIn His Nearness
"I see."Marissa's reply was curt,and she studiedTheodore's face as though trying to read thethoughts behind his calm expression.
It surprised her to realize that the stilettos were moretrouble than she could manage.
Had she known how much they would hurt,shenever would have worn them in the first place.
She leaned forward to remove the shoes,yet whenher eyes caught the carpet covered in vivid floraldesigns,she froze.The thought of what might belurking in those fibers made her skin crawl,so shestood upright again,pretending nothing hadhappened.
In her mind,true authority never relied onappearances. Still, she was aware that manners had their place.

There were certain events, like this grand banquet,where elegance was expected.

Marissa's attention drifted to her phone.

The gossip linking her to Marc had slipped to fourth on the trending list, and as she watched the screen,the number continued to drop.

At the same time, gossip about the two Fletcher daughters fighting over one man was spreading like wildfire, pushing its way into the top three headlines.The app struggled to keep up, freezing for moments before sluggishly reloading.

Shadow cloaked Marissa's features, leaving her face unreadable.

Chaos filled the trending section.

"Fake heiress storms the wedding to snatch the real one's fiancé!"

"Adopted daughter lashes out at her family's chosen heiress after being kicked cut of the wedding
ceremony!"

"Revealing the secrets of the Fletcher family!"

Marissa's thumb lingered on the glowing screen as
she scrolled down. Each article seemed to echo the
same foolish nonsense.

slums, and even after twenty years with the wealthy
Fletchers, she never quite learned their manners.
They said a person carries bad habits in their blood,
impossible to erase no matter their upbringing.

Altogether, she was painted as nothing more than a
pathetic wretch, stripped of any decency or grace.

Insults piled up, each one dirtier than the last, until  her name was buried under a mountain of contempt.

It didn't take a genius to notice how many of those voices were paid to steer the crowd's opinion.

"My goodness, how could she be that brazen? She tried to snatch her sister's fiancé!"

"The Fletchers? Never heard of them. Who are they?"

"Word is, they've got money but prefer to keep things quiet."

"Oh, really? Sounds like you know more than you're letting on. Tell us everything."

"It's just another cliché-rich family mess! Don't you people read those novels? The two women were swapped at birth! Look at the pictures yourself. The adopted one looks plain compared to the real daughter."

"Since we're already talking about this, l've got a drama recommendation for you." "If she doesn't know how to do her makeup, she can pay someone to do it."

"Right, that's what I was thinking!"

Despite its place among the top trends, the discussion lacked substance.

Most of the comments were a jumble of nonsense,fueled by trolls and gossipmongers rather than people with sense.

A few users seemed to live for chaos, latching onto popular tags without even glancing at the article,which led to strings of comments that made no sense at all.

Marissa's name was front and center in the trending post, and the mob of trolls followed the trail to the Fletcher Group's official page. The account was flooded with mentions, and the staff behind it didn't dare type a single word in response.

On the screen before her, Marissa pulled up one of the circulating photos and enlarged it.  If her name hadn't been plastered on the post, she doubted she would have recognized the woman in the picture.

The image had been distorted beyond reason-her skin roughened, freckles multiplied, blemishes deepened, and someone had even painted a garish shade of red across her lips.

As if that weren't enough, the photo showed her with jutting teeth and limp strands of thinning hair.

One glance at it could send a child wailing through the night.

It was obvious that whoever had done this bore deep resentment. They had gathered countless pictures of her, twisted them mercilessly, and crafted a version of her that even her closest friends wouldn't believe was real.

The amount of time spent on such cruelty was almost impressive.

A faint laugh escaped Marissa. She continued scrolling,amused at the wave of comments flooding in-praising the real daughter for her grace while tearing down the fake one for her lack of shame.

Marissa skimmed through the posts with sharp focus, her quick memory catching every detail boefore she slipped her phone back into her purse.

All that effort and money had been wasted. She could leave the place right now, and no one would even realize she was Marissa.

Her fingers brushed against her chin as an idea began to take shape in her mind.

Nearby, Theodore had witnessed almost everything she'd seen.

He lowered his gaze to study her face, his lips tightening slightly. A subtle movement of his throat followed as he tried to steady the flicker of emotion in his eyes.

She carried herself with far more strength than he'd expected, and that spared him from offering any  words of comfort.

However, he couldn't decide whether her composure made him relieved or uneasy.

A short distance away, a couch waited quietly for guests in the corner of the hall.

Theodore's gaze lingered on Marissa for only a moment before he moved without warning. In one smooth motion, he lifted her into his arms and carried her toward the couch, lowering her onto the cushions with deliberate care.

A quiet breath escaped her lips as surprise flickered across her face, realizing his gesture had crossed a line.

Even so, she found no discomfort in his nearness.The thought of stepping back never once crossed her mind.

A wave of contemplation followed.

She had always believed she wasn't the kind of woman easily moved by a man's charm. When her eyes caught the sharp edges of his profile,she gave a subtle nod to herself. In her mind,Theodore was bound to be her husband.

Once she was steady on her feet, Theodore reached into his suit, pulled out his phone, scrolled to a name,and typed a brief message before sending it.
###Chapter 86 New Beginning


Wilbur was busy carrying out Theodore's instructions, while Boden took charge of recording everything that unfolded.

For several minutes straight, the clicking of Boden's camera didn't stop.

He wanted to get closer, to capture Theodore's and Marissa's expressions upclose, but he held himself back, keeping a safe distance so as not to disturb the atmosphere between them.

Marissa had a handbag, carefully chosen by Lottie to match her outfit, dangling from her arm. Theodore took it from her and set it neatly on the couch beside them.

She found herself staring at him blankly as he crouched down in front of her again.

Her gaze dropped to the high heels he had helped her remove earlier, now resting neatly by the sofa.

Something felt strange. The situation wasn't quite aligning with what she had expected.

Was Theodore always this considerate?

That didn't fit the information she'd received.

According to Benny's reports, Theodore was emotionally oblivious and showed little interest in women.

But the man in front of her didn't seem that way at all. He was confident, composed, and strangely attentive.

Was she just blinded by his looks, letting them tint her judgment?

No, that couldn't be it. Absolutely not.

She took a steady breath. Truth be told, shehad a weakness for men like him. She'd grown up believing she deserved the best and never saw the point in settling for less. During her years attending to Bryson, they hadn't shared a kiss, let alone anything more intimate.

She wasn't someone who tolerated unhappiness for the sake of appearances. There had been no spark between her and Bryson, and honestly, he probably felt the same.

Brushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear,Marissa's thoughts drifted to Bryson and Evelina. Her expression hardened slightly as she pulled out her phone.

Maybe it was time to call the police.

If Bryson wanted to cozy up with Evelina, so be it.

A strong woman moved forward, not backward.

And Marissa had already decided that Theodore would be her new beginning.

The thought made her lips twitch slightly. Almost without realizing it, she shifted her leg closer until her knee brushed against his hand. She wasn't imagining it. Theodore seemed drawn to her too.

And if that was true, then maybe she should...

Her train of thought faltered. She blinked, opened her phone, and scrolled through her chat with Benny.

Rumor-spreading was against the law, wasn't it?

She thought about the comments flooding the trending news and hoped the incident would escalate -enough to justify calling the police.

Marissa set her phone aside.

Fine.She'd wait it out. Once the rumors reached their peak, she'd report them all and have those trolls dragged to the police station.

She wasn't used to wearing dresses, much less the kind of soft, flowing gown she had on now, slit high enough to make her feel oddly self-aware. In her mind, she was still dressed in her usual comfortable clothes, not this figure-hugging outfit. So when she casually shifted her leg toward Theodore's hand, the movement caused her legs to part slightly, the smooth skin of her thigh catching the light in a way that drew attention without trying.

Theodore didn't stand up right away. His gaze flicked down, his brow barely moving, but something sharp flashed in his eyes. Without saying a word, his hand reached out and wrapped around her slender ankle,guiding her legs back together with a subtle,restrained motion.

Marissa had been lost in thought, completely forgetting her earlier actions. Her calm gaze lifted to meet his face, curious at his silence.

Their eyes met halfway, his deep and unreadable,hers questioning.

She tilted her head slightly, a playful curve forming on her lips. "It hurts a little," she murmured."Did the heels cut into my skin?"

Leaning back, she rested her chin on her hand. Theodore's eyes trailed from her face down to her ankle. He examined the spot carefully before replying, his voice even, "No."

"That's a relief." She followed his gaze down to where his hand still lingered.

He adjusted his posture, resting her foot gently on his knee. His tone softened, his demeanor easy and calm. "It's just a little red. I'll put some ointment on it later."

Marissa's heart skipped.

He was effortlessly charming.

"Thank you," she said softly, her head lowered slightly.

A strand of hair slipped loose, brushing against her cheek,catching the faintest breeze.

The small movement somehow made her look more delicate, almost heartbreakingly so.

Theodore's fingers twitched at his side. He wanted to reach out and pat her head, but remembering that his hand had just brushed against her ankle, he held himself back.

Meanwhile, Wilbur, who had just arrived with the shoes and ointment, seemed to understand the atmosphere perfectly. Instead of interrupting, he stayed at a distance.

After a brief pause, Theodore spoke quietly. "No need to thank me."

Then he gestured for Wilbur to come closer.

Wilbur quickly stepped forward, setting down the ointment, cotton swabs, and a box with flat shoes beside Theodore.

Without saying a word, he left as discreetly as he'd come.

Twisting open the ointment tube, Theodore squeezed a small amount onto a cotton swab. As he dabbed it gently over the reddened skin, he murmured, "It might sting for a second." Marissa's breath hitched slight'y. She couldn't look away from the man kneeling before her. Their eyes met again, and all she could do was nod quietly.

When he finished applying the ointment, Theodore picked up the shoes and placed them neatly in front of her feet. He didn't try to put them on for her and simply set them there, giving her the choice.
###Chapter 87 Theodore's Consideration
Marissa relaxed, letting out a quiet sigh, feeling more at ease. Her hand rested on her thigh. "Thank you,"she said softly.

She couldn't tell if Theodore's actions were genuine or a pretense, but it didn't matter to her.

She valued sincerity and didn't shy away from real
feelings just because they were new to her.

Feelings were the most important thing to her.

Sincerity and directness were qualities that Marissa exemplified.

"You're welcome," Theodore said, offering a quick smile before his face turned serious again.

He stood straight, not sitting on the couch, and motioned to Wilbur, who was standing nearby. Wilbur pulled a tablet from his briefcase, glanced at Marissa, and lowered his voice. "The journalists at the entrance were cleared by the police. The driver and bodyguards are ready."

He added, "Mr. Curtis sent more bodyguards from our security company."

The Brooks family's business covered many industries, with their security division being a major player,though few knew about it.

Wilbur spoke quietly, but Marissa heard every word and looked up, thinking it over.

Theodore focused on the tablet but didn't take it.

Noticing Marissa's gaze, he saw she hadn't put on her shoes and asked, "Need help?"

"No, I'm good," Marissa replied quickly, then felt her tone was too sharp. She pressed her lips together.

Marc had said Theodore was a busy man, yet he was here for her. "If you have work, don't let me keep you," she said softly.

She wasn't one to hold others back-if she were him,she'd already be gone.

With a deft movement, she knelt, slipped on the flats she'd borrowed from Theodore, and rose, finding them surprisingly comfortable.

She carefully tucked her high heels into the box,lifted it, and turned to Theodore. "Care to join me in the restroom?" she asked, her tone light but deliberate.

Marissa had noticed Theodore's fastidious nature.From the moment he stood, his hands remained still,avoiding contact with the tablet Wilbur clutched.

"No work, no rush. Let's go," Theodore replied, his voice clipped, accepting her invitation without hesitation.

His brevity was striking, and he answered every question with precision, earning a quiet nod of approval from Marissa.

Suddenly,a sharp clatter broke the moment.

Boden's phone hit the floor, its screen splintering into a mosaic of cracks.

He stared at Marissa, wide-eyed, disbelief etched across his face.

Marissa's audacity left jaws on the floor-she asked Theodore to join her in the restroom?

Boden frowned. Should he pick up some protection for them first, or give Marc a ring?

Boden ran his fingers through his hair, his head swimming with thoughts that had no business being there. Maybe he ought to throw out the idea of booking a room first?

Wilbur was just as caught off guard by Marissa's brazen words, his mind running down the same track as Boden's.

Neither of them could bring themselves to look up until Boden broke the silence. "Sorry, butterfingers."

But Marissa and Theodore weren't reading half as much into it as they were.

Marissa's eyes landed on Boden, taking in his face for a beat or two, before she offered some advice."You'd do well to catch more sleep and lay off the coffee-it'll help with those heart flutters."

"Huh?" Boden was drawing a blank on what she meant and was about to dig deeper when he locked eyes with Theodore's cool, detached stare.Something about that look sent a shiver crawling up his spine, and the question died on his lips.

Wilbur scooped up Boden's phone and squeezed his shoulder, a silent pat of comfort.

Theodore held out his hand to Marissa.

Marissa's mind went intoa spin. Did they honestly need to hold hands just to hit the restroom?

She glanced up at him and tentatively extended her hand. "Do you..." Theodore let a few seconds tick by, then took her hand while also collecting her shoe box and bag.

"Miss Curtis, allow me." Wilbur didn't need Theodore to spell it out and immediately relieved him of the items.

Boden shoved his phone into his briefcase, fished out a backup, and kept right on snapping shots of their retreating figures.

He murmured, "Wilbur, don't you think Mr. Brooks and Miss Curtis..."

"They're a match made in heaven!" Wilbur cut in.

Boden watched him firing away with his camera and,not one to be left in the dust, started clicking too,bundling the whole batch off to Marc, who was grinding away at the office.

Wilbur, seeing them disappear into the restroom,made a move to follow.

"What on earth are you doing?" Boden blurted out in shock. Tailing them into the restroom was crossing a line.
Wilbur shot back without missing a beat, "Mirror selfies, ever heard of them? They're gold for photos!"

He'd just been scrolling through the comments,where half the onlookers were convinced Marc and Marissa were meant to be, judging purely by their silhouettes.
Wilbur had rolled his eyes at those takes. He still held firm that Theodore and Marissa were the real deal.

"What are you going on about?" Boden was completely lost.

Did Wilbur want to take pictures against the backdrop of the mirror? In a restroom?

"Get with the times; you're stuck in the Stone Age."Wilbur shook his head and strode off.

Boden remained motionless.
 
On second thought, it might be a good idea. With that in mind, he rushed to catch up.
###Chapter 88 Bryson's Suspicion


At Harmony Hospital, Evelina had just finished her treatment.

The ice pack had helped a little. Her cheeks weren't as red or swollen anymore, but the bluish mark on her forehead and the bump underneath were still painfully visible. They weren't going anywhere anytime soon.
Once the doctor and nurse exited the room, Evelina quickly dismissed Phil's assistant with a casual wave.

Her lips curled into a wide grin as she scrolled through her phone. She and Marissa were all over the trending searches. The public adored her, while Marissa bore the brunt of the criticism. However, her satisfaction was short-lived when her phone buzzed with a call from Bryson.

"Don't respond to anything online," he instructed firmly."Let me handle this." "Alright." Evelina's voice trembled, laced with tears she wasn't actually feeling. "Thank you, darling."

"Since your photos are already out there, stay home for a few days. I'll send an assistant to bring you back."

"Darling, you don't believe those awful rumors, do you?" Evelina asked carefully, barely breathing as she waited for his answer.

The stories online were a messy mix of truth and lies,spun to mislead the public. But even so, they were dangerous.

Evelina's stomach twisted at the thought of her secret slipping out. She didn't care what the world thought, but Bryson's opinion mattered. It mattered more than anything.

"Of course not," he said firmly. "I know exactly what kind of person you are." Then, after a short pause, he added, "Even if those rumors are true, it's no big deal." Evelina froze. Her throat tightened as she asked in confusion, "Why?"

"Evelina, I'm your husband. Even if those things turned out to be true, it wouldn't change my trust in you."

The Hardy and Fletcher families were now tied together by both power and reputation, so whatever happened to one affected the other.

Bryson knew that better than anyone, and he wasn't about to start a fight with Evelina now.

First, they had to face their enemies outside before fixing anything between them.

Evelina didn't fully understand his words; she only heard what she wanted to, and a wave of pride washed over her as she thought about how flawlessly she had hidden her secrets.

"Thank you, honey," she cooed, smiling sweetly into the phone. "Thank you for trusting me. Love you so much." Bryson sighed, rubbing his temples, and hung up.But as he continued scrolling through the trending topics, his expression darkened.

One photo caught his attention-a blurry image of Marissa and a young man entering a restaurant together.

The picture wasn't clear, but he recognized her immediately.

Evelina hadn't told him what had really gone down at the makeup studio, but from the fragments she had shared, Bryson had already begun piecing the puzzle together on his own.

In truth, Bryson didn't care much about the Fletcher family's drama. Whether it was Evelina or Marissa who had taken care of him didn't matter.

However,now he feltstrangely restless.

He searched for Marissa's profile on WhatsApp for a long while, scrolling through names, bout her avatar was nowhere to be found. With a scowl, he turned off the screen and leaned back in his chair.

Could it really be as Marissa had once said-that during the time he was blind and deaf to the world,the one who cared for him wasn't Evelina at all, but her?

He thought of asking Jenna, but she always dodged any mention of Marissa. That hesitation from her only deepened his suspicion. Bryson exhaled slowly.

It seemed he'd have to look into this matter himself quietly.

Just then, his assistant walked in with a cup of steaming coffee.

"Mr. Hardy, your coffee," the young man said softly.

Bryson gave him a curt nod and gestured for himn to leave.

Picking up on the tense atmosphere, the assistant quickly set the cup on the table and left the room without another word. Bryson took a sip, opened his phone again, and started scrolling through the trending topics.

He wasn't one for gossip and had no patience for these kinds of things, but one particular post caught his eye. It was a long comment thread attached to a photo. Out of curiosity, he tapped on it.

The moment the image loaded, his blood ran cold. It was him, in sunglasses, standing beside Marissa.

They weren't close, and there was nothing suggestive about their posture, but the camera had zoomed in on one thing-the burn scar on her hand.

Rage shot through him in an instant.

His grip tightened, and inthe next second, his phone crashed against the wall with a deafening crack.

The sound made the assistant freeze mid-step, his hand still on the office door handle.

A few voices drifted in from the corridor."What was that noise?" "Well,someone must be having a hard time with their work and couldn't hold back anymore," one of them muttered half-jokingly.

The assistant turned back just in time to meet Bryson's cold, menacing stare through the slightly open door.

He immediately shut it and hurried to fetch the spare phone.

When he returned, he saw the smashed device on the floor-its screen cracked like shattered glass, yet still glowing faintly.

The image of Bryson and Marissa was frozen in place.

The assistant's eyes widened. He was new to Bryson's team, but even he could tell that whatever this photo meant, it spelled serious trouble.

These wealthy families were always tangled in something messy.
 
He carefully picked up the broken phone, set it back on the desk, and stepped aside silently.

Bryson's face was grim as his gaze lingered on the photo. His hand in the picture held a thermos, but the lid was in Marissa's hand.

What on earth had happened during the time he couldn't see or hear?

His thoughts spiraled. His two previous personal assistants had both resigned within the past few weeks-another coincidence that suddenly didn't feel like one.

With a sharp slam, Bryson's fist hit the desk. The cup rattled, spilling coffee across the surface.

Brown liquid spread, seeping under the broken phone. The screen flickered a few times and then went completely dark.
###Chapter 89 Find Me A Private Investigator
"Mr. Hardy..." The assistant stood frozen for a moment, holding the spare phone. It had only been a week since he had joined, and already he was neck-deep in situations that felt well above his pay grade.

Still, even he had to admit that Marissa was stunning.

The phone screen on the table dimmed and went completely black.

Bryson rubbed his temples in frustration,reached for his work tablet, and tried refreshing the trending feed once more.

It wouldn't load, no matter how many times he refreshed. Whether it was a connection problem or the news itself overwhelming the servers, he couldn't tell.

Finally, he set the tablet aside. "Where's your phone?"

The assistant cursed himself inwardly for not being faster. He should've anticipated this. Hesitantly, he unlocked his personal phone, opened the app, and handed it over. "Here you go, Mr. Hardy."

"Next time, be quicker and more efficient," Bryson said coolly as he took the phone.

"Yes, sir," the assistant muttered, shooting one last mournful look at the phone his girlfriend had just gifted him before diving into switching SIMs and syncing all of Bryson's accounts.

"Did the company forget to pay the internet bill or something?" Bryson asked irritably after yet another failed attempt.

To him, a page that refused to load simply meant no internet connection.

"Uh... no, sir," the assistant murmured after checking. Both data and Wi-Fi were working perfectly fine. Bryson frowned and handed the phone back. "Then why does it just keep refreshing?"

"The server's probably overloaded," the assistant explained quickly. "It happens sometimes when a story blows up online. The tech team at Twitter is likely already fixing it. It should open soon."

He spoke carefully, trying to keep his tone calm while discreetly watching Bryson's expression.

For a moment, Bryson said nothing. He stared at the phone, thumb tapping the screen as if lost in thought. Then, suddenly, he asked, "Did you see that photo earlier?"

The assistant stiffened. This was exactly the kind of question he'd hoped to avoid. He didn't want to get involved in the personal affairs of the rich, or worse,his boss's. But he couldn't lie either. After a few seconds of uneasy silence, he finally replied, "I didn't look too closely, sir. It seemed like a picture of you with Miss Marissa Fletcher, your wife's adopted sister. The one from the hospital."
 His palms were damp. He hadn't even been this nervous during his job interview.

Remembering Bryson's rule about not dodging names, he forced himself to say Marissa's outright.

Bryson's jaw tightened. He pressed the side button of the phone repeatedly, the screen flickering on and off in nis hand.

That photo...just how old was it?

It didn't look recent. Someone close to either him or Marissa must've taken it back then.

Could it have been one of his former personal assistants? Both had quit suspiciously close together.

And why release it now of all times?

Bryson's mind raced, but without seeing the comments online, he couldn't predict how the public was reacting.

At last, he spoke in a controlled voice. "Find me a private investigator. Keep monitoring everything online and contact someone to remove the trending post as soon as possible."

The assistant straightened immediately."Understood,Mr.Hardy."

The assistant had almost reached the door when Bryson's voice made him stop in his tracks.

"Wait. Also, make sure anything tied to the Fletcher family gets buried. All of it."

Bryson didn't fully understand Marissa's connection to Marc, but that photo of the two of them had stirred something raw and unfamiliar inside him, like a flash of possessiveness he couldn't quite explain.
He didn't want her linked to anyone else, not until he uncovered everything hidden beneath the surface.

Meanwhile, inside the restroom of Lottie's private makeup studio, the air carried the faint scent of cosmetics and perfume.

Theodore had already seen the trending headlines. Since he hadn't said a word about it, Marissa briefly considered mentioning it herself.

She wasn't too concerned about what he thought.

For now, she was just stepping into her role as Theodore's fiancée, and nothing more.

But as she mulled over her thoughts, Theodore suddenly spoke up. "Do you want me to help you handle the online buzz?"

Marissa blinked, surprised by his offer. Of all moments, she hadn't expected him to bring it up now.

Theodore added quickly, "I wasn't trying to pry into your private matters. I just happened to come across it."

Marissa gave a light smile. "It's fine. No need to trouble yourself over it, Mr. Brooks."

Theodore gave a short nod, his expression unchanged, though his eyes had noticeably cooled. Marissa sensed something off in his demeanor. She parted her lips to speak but then decided against it.

It wasn't the right moment to explain anything, not yet.

When they stepped out of the restroom, the shift in the air was almost tangible. Wilbur stood there with his phone in hand, uncertain whether to keep filming or put it away.

He couldn't understand why the air between them felt so different now compared to earlier.

A deep sense of frustration washed over him, and for reasons he couldn't quite explain, his chest tightened with sadness.

"Mr.Brooks."

The way she spoke-formal, polite, and distant-drew a clear line between them.

Theodore slowed his pace to walk beside her,glancing sideways into her calm, clear eyes. A teasing smile played on his lips. "Miss Curtis," he said smoothly, "don't you think it's time we changed how we address each other?"
###Chapter 90 Honey


Marissa's lips parted slightly.

If she couldn't call him Mr. Brooks, then what was she supposed to call him?

Theodore,maybe? Or perhaps...something else?

"Honey?" she said evenly, her tone so calm it was almost deadpan.
Theodore coughed lightly, raising a hand to his lips as if to compose himself. It was rare to see him flustered, but the faint pink on his ears betrayed him.

Behind them, Boden nearly choked on air. He coughed so violently that his eyes watered, caught completely off guard by Marissa's unexpected form of address.

Marissa turned, brows knitting together slightly.
 
Was there something wrong with him physically? "You should really visit a hospital for a check-up,"she said with sincere concern.

They continued the conversation while walking out together.

"Me?" Boden blurted, catching up to her quickly."No, no, I just did a full medical exam recently! I'm perfectly fine."

It wasn't illness. He had simply been shocked by Marissa's boldness. And now she was teasing him about it!

Marissa gave a small nod, her attention returning to Theodore. "So, what do you think of that name? Do you like it?"

Theodore didn't answer immediately.

His eyes darkened a little, carrying a glint that hinted at danger or perhaps jealousy.

Had she ever used that same word with Bryson before? Without a word, he opened the car door and placed his hand above it to shield her head.

"You don't like it?" Marissa pressed, her tone flat but her eyes sparkling mischievously.

Theodore let out a soft chuckle, his voice warm but controlled. "You can address me however you'd like."

In other words, he didn't mind.

Marissa caught on instantly.

She slid gracefully into the car, showing no trace of embarrassment, and said with a straight face,"Alright then, honey."

Theodore rubbed his forehead with a helpless smile."You sound so stiff."

"How could you say that, honey?" Marissa crooned,mimicking Evelina's syrupy, flirtatious tone perfectly.

If he hadn't seen her expression, Theodore might've actually believed the act, but her straight face gave her away completely. The two of them continued chatting casually in the back seat.

Up front in the passenger seat, Wilbur was keeping a close eye on the online trends.

Someone had just called him to report that before they could intervene, one party was already working to remove the trending topics, while yet another was paying big money to keep them up.

It turned into an online tug-of-war, neither side backing down, until the servers finally crashed.Twitter's tech team was scrambling to fix it.

Could the Curtis family be behind this?

And who else had enough influence to challenge them head-on?

Wilbur frowned slightly and glanced at the rearview mirror.

The two in the back were still deep in conversation,completely at ease with each other. Marissa leaned back in her seat, tapping her fingers lightly on her knee as she explained why she hadn't turned to Theodore for help. "I'm planning to reportit to the police," she said simply.

Theodore was momentarily taken aback. He had already gone through a list of potential solutions in his head-simple, efficient, and ready for execution.

Yet, of all the possibilities he had considered,Marissa's approach was not one of them.

Given the Brooks family's influence, their name alone could resolve countless problems without much effort.

But he caught on quickly. "You're right. Reporting it to the police would work."

As he spoke, he gave a few light taps, signaling Wilbur in the passenger seat, who immediately responded with a nod.

Not wanting to interrupt the growing connection between Marissa and Theodore, Wilbur hesitated,then pulled out his phone to type a message explaining everything clearly.

But after only typing two words, he froze and glanced back.

Theodore had already picked up on why Marissa wanted to involve the police. His calm voice broke the silence. "Do you think the situation's serious enough for the police to step in?"

Marissa opened her mouth to reply, but her eyes flicked to Wilbur, who was looking back at them. She paused. "If there's something important you need to discuss, go ahead. I'll put on my headphones."

Wilbur quickly waved his hand. "No, no... it's not about work." He shot a look at Theodore, then added, "Since Miss Curtis's already involved, it's better to talk things through openly."

He had overheard Marissa's mention of calling the police earlier.

Her composed tone suggested she already had a plan. The last thing he wanted was for Theodore to derail her strategy.

Still, something felt off. Could there be another twist in the online situation?

"Go ahead." Theodore's words were succinct.

Wilbur hesitated, not wanting to ruin the rare,almost gentle atmosphere between them. After a deep breath, he straightened up and said, "The trending topic's been taken down."

Marissa froze for a second. "Taken down?" She quickly grabbed her phone. The last time she checked, the topic was still climbing the charts.

She had planned to let it run wild, to let the public outrage peak before she made her move, exposing the truth and ensuring those spreading the rumors would face consequences without her having to explain herself.

Wilbur continued, "Two groups are fighting over it.The topic keeps going up and down. Twitter's server even crashed-they're still trying to fix it." Marissa's expression shifted. She understood immediately.

Her team was boosting the exposure, but who was trying to suppress it? The Curtis family,maybe?

Without hesitation, she dialed Marc's number.

"Rissa, what's up?" Marc answered the call almost instantly.

"Marc," she said, wasting no time, "did you have the trending topic taken down?"

Marc's voice came back with a hint of confusion."Yeah, I did. But my guys said there's another group outbidding us to do the same. Is it Theodore? Wait,are you two together right now?"
###Chapter 91 She Might Be Feeling Lost Right Now


All traces of the gossip linking Marc and Marissa had vanished from the internet, wiped so clean it was as if it had never existed.

Yet, the Fletcher family's name still dominated the trending charts, holding firm among the top three topics.

Caught up in a whirlwind of work, Marc hadn't found the time to look into the chaos surrounding them.

Without hesitation, he gave a clear order to his team-every mention of the Fletcher family was to be scrubbed from every platform immediately.

However, the moment his offer went up, someone else raised the stakes, determined to keep the topic alive.What followed was an online tug-of-war between equally powerful forces, slowing the platforms to a crawl as pages struggled to load.

"Rissa, leave this mess to me. I'll take care of it," Marc said as he sifted through a stack of photographs.

The images had come directly from Boden, who had clearly enjoyed himself while compiling them.

If he could, Marc thought, Boden would've added witty captions under each photo.

Marissa and Theodore looked every bit the perfect pair.

After sending the photos to his brothers in the Curtis family group chat, Marc didn't have to wait long for their reactions to roll in.

Everyone, except Andrew, who voiced his strong objection, agreed that Theodore and Marissa should be left alone to see where things might lead.

If their bond deepened, all the better. But if it didn't, then no matter how remarkable Theodore was,he still wouldn't be the right man for her.

Inside the car, a calm silence lingered while Marc's voice filtered through the speaker. Marissa wasn't certain whether Theodore had already made his move, though she suspected he was quietly working behind the scenes. He always struck her as someone who planned several steps.

"Give me a moment. I'll ask him myself," Marissa said, turning toward Theodore.

Wilbur looked like he wanted to interrupt, but thought better of it.

"I haven't made a move yet," Theodore answered eveny,his tone giving nothing away.

"Understood," Marc replied before pausing briefly. His voice softened as he asked, "Rissa, what is it that you really want to happen?"

"Marc, let's leave this matter aside for now. I already have something in motion," Marissa said with quiet confidence.

Having recognized her capability, Marc didn't press for details. "If you need my help, you only have to ask.I'll be here," he said to her.

"I appreciateit111Marissa replied before ending the call.

Since Theodore hadn't taken any steps yet, it left her wondering who had meddled.

It didn't take long for Marissa to piece it together-Evelina's hand was almost certainly in play.
Things were only warming up, not yet at the point of real concern. She had already instructed Benny to inform her once the situation escalated enough for the authorities to step in, giving her time to prepare.

With Marc staying out of it, Bryson was unable to compete with the power behnd those,trending manipulations. He had little choice but to withdraw.

Back in his office, Bryson ended a tense call with Evelina and pressed his fingers to his temples, weariness seeping through him.

On his desk, his assistant had already placed a slip of paper with a private investigator's number-an option Bryson was beginning to seriously consider.

"Any updates?" Bryson's tone carried a low edge, calm but expectant. "None so far," the assistant answered quickly, already tense. It had barely been any time at all-results couldn't appear out of thin air.

Bryson's thumb hesitated over Marissa's contact, uncertainty flickering in his gaze.

The number had come from Evelina, of course.

Bryson couldn't bring himself to believe that the Curtis family would step in to clean up Marissa's mess.

He was certain she was just a passing fancy for Marc, who would discard her soon enough.

Men born into wealth always protected their image. Before choosing a wife who matched their social standing, they made sure nothing-no scandal, no woman-could stain their name.

Now that Marissa had lost the Fletcher family's shield, Bryson wondered how she would endure the storm that followed.

The strange thing was, she hadn't called him. Did Marc care for her after all? Had he been the one to clean everything up?

Bryson opened the app again-this time,he skipped the threads about the Fletcher family and went straight to search for the ones linking Marissa and Marc.

However,after reaching the very end of the feed, Bryson still found nothing.

Could Marc truly be that devoted to Marissa?

A faint irritation stirred within Bryson as he reopened the top trending lists.

The same headlines glared back-every one of them revolving around the Fletcher family, every comment dripping with contempt toward Marissa. Something in his chest twisted at the sight.

For a family with as much influence as the Curtis family, shouldn't this have been dealt with already?

His thumb hovered over the call screen, hesitation flickering across his face. Reaching out now might only deepen Marissa's attachment to him, making it harder for her to move on.

Still, he reasoned, as her brother-in-law, lending a hand wouldn't be out of place. Then again, maybe it would be better to wait until she turned to him first.

But that was unlikely-Marissa wasn't the type to ask for help easily.

"Have any unfamiliar numbers been trying to reach us?" Bryson finally asked, shifting tactics.

At first, the assistant looked puzzled. Then, noticing the call screen glowing on Bryson's phone,he ventured a guess. "A distress call, perhaps?"

The implication wasn't lost on him-Bryson seemed to be waiting for Marissa to reach out.

"That's right," Bryson answered evenly, his tone giving nothing away.

Helping her wasn't something he wanted to do, yet refusing to act felt even worse.

His gaze drifted toward his assistant.

"Maybe it's best if you phone Miss Marissa Fletcher instead,"the assistant said carefully.

"Why should I?" Bryson shot back, his expression darkening.

Truthfully, he just didn't want to be the first to make the move, which was exactly why he'd asked in the first place.

Finally grasping the turmoil in Bryson's mind, the assistant said gently,′′Sirishe might be feeling lost right now... unsure who else she can turn to."

"Feeling lost?" Bryson muttered to himself. Marissa had never been one to break down easily, unlike Evelina.StiIl, the question lingered. Why hadn't she reached out to him yet?

The assistant explained, "Miss Marissa Fletcher might be unsettled. She's never dealt with anything like this before. Even strong women falter when things spiral out of control. Sometimes, they just need someone to remind them they're not alone. Maybe you should call her."

No reply came from Bryson. His silence was heavy, filled with unspoken thoughts.

"You're her brother-in-law," the assistant added.|′Sperfectly reasonable for you to check in. She'd probably appreciate the gesture." It was easy to see what Bryson was really doing-searching for a reason that would justify his concern.

The assistant felt a pang of sympathy for Bryson's wife-poor Evelina, lying in a hospital bed, completely unaware of her husband's concern for her sister.
###Chapter 92 Are You Still Capable In Bed


Bryson remained motionless, while his assistant nearly collapsed from exhaustion after countless failea attempts to sway him.

"Mr. Hardy..." the assistant began cautiously, but Bryson's sharp, icy tone cuthim off.

"Shut up!" A single sideways glare silenced the assistant instantly.

The assistant rolled his eyes discreetly-did Bryson think he enjoyed this ordeal? He had been talking until his throat felt scorched!

Though irritated,Bryson understood his assistant was right.

Exhaling slowly, he picked up his phone and dialed Marissa's number.

As the line rang, his thoughts drifted.

Standing by while Marissa suffered was simply not an option-especially after she had been heartlessly discarded by another man.

Seeing the call connected, his assistant quietly excused himself from the room.

Meanwhile,social media was spiraling out of control. Twitter buzzed like a hornet's nest, hashtags flying up the charts.

What began as a trivial rumor had snowballed into a frenzy of speculation. Curious users tried to guess which wealthy families were clashing and spending lavishly to outdo one another.

Rumors raced across the internet like wildfire.

The statement from the Fletcher family shot straight to the top of the trending list, reigniting speculation about what scandal had caused the fake heiress to be cast out.

Online discussions exploded, with users convinced that one faction had already triumphed while the other scrambled to control the fallout.

Gossip thrived in the chaos, and everyone knew that whoever broke the silence first would instantly become the focal point of attention-yet no one stepped forward.

The lack of response only fueled wilder theories. Soon, talk turned absurd, with some even claiming Marissa had secretly been involved with Phil behind Susanna's back.

When Marissa scrolled through the mess online, she was speechless at how far people's imaginations could stretch.

Phil and her? Really?

But then, a thought struck her-a possibility she hadn't considered before.

Could Susanna's hostility toward her stem from this very misunderstanding?

The realization made her laugh suddenly, a quiet but strange sound that drew Theodore's attention.He glanced at her curiously but didn't look at her phone.

Theodore had also seen the online chaos and recognized that things were spiraling out of control. "Should we head to the banquet first or contact the authorities?" he asked evenly.

Marissa hesitated briefly before replying, "Let's hold off on calling the police."

She had a hunch that something unexpected might unfold at the banquet.

Her thoughts briefly wandered to Holley-what surprise could she possibly bring tonight?

Theodore didn't press for explanations, and the topic ended there.

Moments later, the car rolled to a stop beneath a grand arched entrance. A sharply dressed attendant moved to open the door but was stopped by the Brooks family's bodyguards, who stood like sentinels on either side.

"Mr. Brooks," one greeted respectfully before stepping back and opening the door himself.

Theodore exited first, offering his hand to Marissa. "We've arrived."
She took his hand and stepped out gracefully, still wearing flats instead of heels. Before she could loop her arm through his, a familiar voice called from nearby.

"Hey, Theodore! Long time no see! Didn't think you would show up here!"

A young man climbed out of a luxury car and strode toward them with a smug grin.

Theodore didn't acknowledge him, instead securing Marissa's hand and leading her inside without so much as a glance.

Marissa looked briefly at the man but didn't ask who he was, matching Theodore's calm pace.

The young man had never seen Marissa before. For a brief moment, her beauty left him speechless-but admiration quickly gave way to resentment.

How bold of Theodore to bring a woman to a Curtis family banquet.

"Theodore, are you planning to break off the engagement with the Curtis family?" Theodore's cousin, Farris Patel, caught up effortlessly, undeterred by Theodore's cold indifference. "By the way, Marc was spotted out with some girl this afternoon."

Theodore didn't bother responding, his expression unreadable. But Farris, ever the talkative type, continued without shame. "No idea who she is. Oh, I heard from my mother that you got injured down there.Is that true? As men, we really shouldn't ignore issues like this-it ends up affecting your private life with your partner..."

His sentence ended in a startled grunt as he suddenly stumbled forward and dropped to his knees with a loud thud.

For a split second, confusion flashed across his face.
Marissa,standing beside Theodore, calmly retracted her foot and looked down at him with polite innocence."Oh my, what happened? You should be more careful," she said lightly, her tone betraying not a hint of guilt.

The action had been instinctive, a reflex she didn't care to explain, and she certainly wasn't about to start now. Farris, oblivious to the real cause of his fall, winced and snapped at Theodore's bodyguards, "What are you staring at? Help me up!"

Farris, thick-skinned as ever, showed no hint of embarrassment over his clumsy fall.

The two bodyguards, having clearly seen Marissa's discreet move, exchanged knowing glances but kept their mouths shut.

They didn't step forward to assist; instead, their eyes flicked toward Theodore, silently awaiting his signal.

Theodore, however, remained perfectly composed, his gaze cold and indifferent as he watched Farris struggle on the ground.

When it became obvious that no help would come, Farris huffed and pushed himself up, brushing the dust off his trousers with an annoyed grunt.

"Damn it! WVhy on earth would the Curtis family pick this dump for a banquet?" he muttered bitterly

His expression darkened with irritation, but his mouth, as usual, didn't stop running.

"Anyway, let's get back to where we left off," he continued as if nothing had happened.

Farris was desperate to confirm whether. Theodore's manhood was truly impaired.

A sly glint flickered in his eyes. Farris had always envied Theodore's steady success and composed nature,but if that rumor about his supposed injury turned out to be true, it would finally give him something to laugh about.

Leaning closer, his tone turned mocking and crude. "Tell me, Theodore, are you still capable... in bed?"
###Chapter 93 Hit The Gym More Often


Marissa blinked,stunned by the question. Her mind spun for a second.

Wait...was Theodore injured down there?

Before she could stop herself, her eyes darted down for a split second, catching a glimpse of his groin.

Theodore, ever perceptive, immediately caught her look. He sighed quietly and was just about to explain when Marissa turned to Farris with a sharp tone. "Have you no manners? Why are you asking him about something so private?"

The bluntness of it stunned her-who openly questioned someone's sexual function in public?

She tilted her head slightly, eyes drifting toward Farris's lower half, unable to hide the confusion and naive interest written all over her face.

For Farris, that kind of unintentional innocence hit all his weak spots. His throat moved as he swallowed hard, and,well...his body had an uninvited reaction to it.

"I wouldn't normally ask something like this!" he blurted out.

Marissa raised a brow, clearly not convinced. "Really?" she said slowly.

Feeling oddly challenged, Farris began,"YOU-"

"Let's go." Theodore's calm but cutting voice sliced through Farris's words. His cold stare alone was enough to make Farris freeze.

He wasn't even talking to Farris-his attention was on Marissa.

She took the cue and turned away, walking off with Theodore. But before disappearing into the crowd, she tossed a casual remark over her shoulder. "You should hit the gym more often."

Her words stung like a punch. Farris stood there, completely thrown off, her words replaying in his head. Hit the gym more often?

He was young, fit, and in perfect shape.

What exactly did she mean by that?

As Marissa and Theodore walked deeper inside, the crowd grew denser. The women glittered in their designer gowns, each one seemingly competing for attention, while the men carried themselves with effortless confidence.

"Who was that guy?" Marissa asked.

"Don't bother with him," Theodore replied casually, giving her arm a light pat. "He's not worth your attention."

He figured she probably wasn't interested in knowing Farris anyway, considering how she'd just roasted him.

But the moment his hand brushed hers, Marissa suddenly pulled her arm back.

"What's wrong?" Theodore's expression faltered, just slightly. The warmth that had flickered in his eyes earlier vanished, replaced by the cool indifference he usually wore.

His gaze dropped to her arm, lingering long enough that Marissa began to feel uneasy.

Wait... wasn't he signaling her to let go?

But seeing that he was still holding his arm out, waiting, Marissa hesitated for a second, then slowly looped her arm through his again.

Theodore's gaze softened almost immediately.

Marissa nearly laughed but held it in.

"I thought when you patted my hand, you wanted me to let go," she explained lightly.

She wasn't the kind of person to let things stay awkward or misunderstood for long. If something felt off,she'd rather clear it up right away. "I just wanted to pat you hand," Theodore said with a faint smile, trying to explain himself.

He had never understood why couples were so clingling once they got together, but now it began to make sense.

When feelings ran deep, the pull to be close, to reach out, to hold the other person, became almost impossible to resist. Theodore pushed the thought aside, forcing himself to stay composed and not cross any lines.

Yet as her earlier words replayed in his mind, the smile slowly disappeared from his face.

Was this kind of casual closeness something she'd picked up from that man before him?

The thought irritated him more than he expected.

At his explanation, Marissa smiled knowingly and leaned a little closer.

The banquet was set to start at eight sharp.

Marissa and Theodore showed up a bit early, choosing to head directly to the lounge.

The Curtis family, hosting the event, had gone all out-bringing an entire team of servants and security to keep everything running perfectly.

One of the staff members had already spread the word among their coworkers that Marissa and Theodore had just arrived.

The pair drew attention effortlessly. Theodore with his tall, composed frame and sharp looks, and Marissa glowing with confidence beside him.

For most guests, nightslike this were less about celebration and more about making connections. Polished smiles and empty compliments filled the air as people floated from one conversation to another, champagne flutes in hand.

When a wave of surprised "wows" rippled through the room, people naturally turned toward the entrance.

Murmurs of admiration began to ripple through the crowd. "Who's that man? He's gorgeous. Look at those shoulders and that jawline!"

"He looks kind of familiar. Has anyone seen the woman with him before?" another asked curiously.

"I might just go say hi. Anyone coming with me?"

Before long, a confident young woman decided to make her move. With a flick of her hair, she took two glasses of champagne from a passing waiter and began walking toward Theodore and Marissa with deliberate grace, her hips swaying subtly with each step.

In these high-society circles, confidence was practically bred into the sons and daughters of the elite.

As soon as she made her move, several well-dressed young men followed, each pretending to look casual while straightening their ties and walking toward them.

However, before anyone could say a word, Theodore and Marissa stepped into the elevator, completely unfazed by the attention.

They rode the elevator directly to the lounge without looking back.

The lounge had been carefully arranged by the Curtis family, complete with attendants, stylists, and an array of gowns and jewelry because one outfit was never enough for such events.

Of course, the men's and women's lounges were separate, each styled to suit its guests.

Without exchanging a word, Theodore and Marissa split up, heading to their own lounges to get ready.

Just as Marissa entered her lounge, a friendly voice called out to her, "Are you here by yourself, Miss Curtis?"
###Chapter 94 What If She Tries To Humiliate Me Again


The one assigned to welcome Marissa happened to be the Curtis family's butler, Brenden.
He had not yet looked at his phone, which meant he remained unaware of the messages piling up in the group chat. The rest of the staff assumed he already knew, so none of them bothered to inform him.

When Marissa arrived, Brenden didn't step aside right away. Instead, his eyes shifted past her toward the end of the corridor.

The place buzzed with movement as staff hurried about, yet none of the Curtis brothers were anywhere in sight.

Even Theodore's absence stood out.

A flicker of surprise crossed Brenden's face, though he quickly tried to hide it.

He recalled how, during her earlier visit, the entire household had gone to great lengths to greet her. Back then, he thought she held a special place in their hearts. Now, he wasn't so sure anymore.

"What's the matter?" MMarissa asked, her calm tone carrying a weight that made Brenden tense.

He lowered his gaze, masking the uncertainty in his eyes as he stepped politely to the side. "Your mother and brothers haven't been informed of your arrival yet. Allow me to notify them. Please rest here for the moment."
Brenden kept his composure, his tone measured despite the subtle hints behind his words. Experience had taught him restraint; after being reprimanded by Marc once before, he knew better than to speak too freely.

He reminded himself quietly of where he stood in the household hierarchy.

"It's fine," Marissa said, her voice .calm and indifferent. For a moment, her gaze lingered on Brenden's expression before she sank gracefully into the sofa.

Her phone rested in her hand as she continued tracking the online uproar, thinking of ways to deal with those trolls later.

"Ellen," Brenden called, motioning for a nearby servant to step forward. "This is Ellen Natt. Miss Curtis,should you require anything, she'll attend to you."

Marissa gave him a glance, her silence serving as acknowledgment.

With a polite smile, Brenden turned and exited the lounge.

Not long after, the servant who had helped settle Theodore approached Brenden."|-"

"Handle it on your own! Stop running to me for every little thing!" Brenden said, his patience thinning as he hurried to make a call before the servant could utter another word.

Left standing in silence, the young servant blinked in confusion, watching him stride quickly into the neighboring lounge.

Brenden planned to reach Holley. Since Marissa had shown up without Theodore, he figured Holley could wait for Theodore's arrival and walk in beside him when the moment came.

Brenden's loyalty naturally leaned toward Holley. After all, he had watched her grow from a child into the woman she was now.

Seeking privacy, he stepped onto the balcony to place the call, never noticing that Marissa was just next door, reclining on a deck chair and scrolling through the latest headlines.

Meanwhile, in a grand villa, Holley was trying to persuade Rita to attend the banquet with her. The thought of Marissa stealing all the attention stirred something sharp in her chest.

They shared the Curtis name, and in her mind, there was no reason Marissa should shine brighter than she did.

Holley pleaded, "Rita, come with me,please!"

Rita pressed a hand against her chest, still feeling the dull ache that refused to fade. Her brows knitted together as she muttered, "Why should I even bother going? Showing up will only give her more attention.I won't go! And you shouldn't either. Let her see that we're not fond of her." The image of Marissa's face surfaced in her mind, reigniting an irritation that made her jaw tighten.

"But Theodore's going to be there," Holley said, her voice gentle and coaxing as she clung to Rita's sleeve."Please, come with me. What if she tries to humiliate me again? Would you really want to see me treated that way?"

Marissa's sharp words still lingered in Rita's memory, and the thought of another public confrontation unsettled her.

A crowded banquet meant plenty of onlookers. If Marissa said something tactless, Rita would be the one embarrassed-and her husband wouldn't take it kindly.

"Rita," Holley said again, her eyes wide and pleading like a child's.

Caught between pride and concern, Rita studied Holley's sweet face. The thought of sending her alone felt wrong, yet the idea of attending the party hosted for Marissa left a bitter taste in her mouth.

Skipping the banquet, Rita thought, would serve as the perfect way to put Marissa in an awkward spot.

What better way to make a statement than through absence?

"Rita, please, just come with me..." Holley urged, her tone turning sweeter as she caught the faint hesitation flickering across Rita's face. She knew how to push just enough to sway her.

A sigh escaped Rita before a gentle smile curved her lips. She lifted her hand and lightly tapped Holley's forehead. "You really do know how to wear me down, don't you?"

A bright laugh burst from Holley as she bounced excitedly. "Then let's go! We're wasting time!"

Before Rita could respond, Holley's phone began to ring.

Her excitement faltered the moment she saw the caller ID-it was Brenden. The sight alone made her lips twist in irritation; he always called for the most insignificant things.

Rita caught the change in Holley's expression and reached out, concern softening her tone."What's the matter? Did something happen? Are you not in the mood to go anymore?" That worked out perfectly for Rita, since she had little desire to attend the banquet in the first place. Maxton had reminded her just that afternoon to take things easy and avoid anything that might stir her emotions.

"If you're not up for it, then we'll stay home," Rita said firmly, already convinced that rest was the wiser choice. "And tell your brother not to go either."
Panicking at the thought that Rita might truly change her mind, Holley quickly thrust her phone forward,her lips curving into a small pout. "It's Marc's butler calling again. I have no idea what he wants this time!"

Rita's eyes narrowed slightly, a flicker of curiosity brightening them as she took the phone from Holley's hand.

"Let me handle it," she said, pressing the answer button."Yes? What is it?"

Brenden's breath hitched when he heard her voice. Glancing down at the caller ID, he frowned in confusion before answering, "M-Mrs. Rita Curtis?"

That couldn't be right. He was certain he had dialed Holley's number.

A strange unease crept over him as he pressed his lips together, his pulse thudding faster while a flicker of confusion clouded his face.
###Chapter 95 Suspicion


From the balcony next door, Marissa overheard Brenden's words and instinctively stilled. A knowing spark flickered in her eyes as she exited Twitter, her fingers already switching to the camera app to start recording.

"What? Shocked to hear my voice?" Rita's tone cut through the receiver, sharp and biting, her gaze fixed on the glowing screen before her.

Brenden's hesitant silence only made her frown deepen, her features hardening into something cold and unforgiving.

"You..." he said, his voice faltering.

A sly smile replaced Rita's earlier sternness. Her lips curved playfully as she tilted her head, voice softening."What's wrong? Don't tell me you weren't hoping to hear from me."

Beside her, Holley blinked in puzzlement, unsure what to make of the sudden change in Rita's tone.

Wasn't that her phone ringing a moment ago?

And wasn't the call from Brenden?

Holley's eyes widened as she studied Rita, confusion etched across her face.

Despite her age, Rita carried herself with the poise of a woman far younger. Her skin still glowed with vitality,and her figure remained as graceful as ever, the kind that turned heads without effort.

Could it be that Rita was having an affair with Brenden?

Holley's lips parted as if to question it, but no words came out. Instead, she simply gazed at Rita in awe, a flicker of amusement dancing in her.eyes. It seemed Rita shared the same spirit as her.

Though she had feelings for Theodore, she was determined to live without restraint, to take what she wanted from life. Inside the hotel, attendants moved about quietly, yet Brenden's startled voice broke the stillness. He instinctively cupped his hand over the phone's microphone, whispering, "Mrs. Curtis... are you feeling alright? I heard you went to the hospital earlier. Is everything okay?"

His tone carried genuine concern, though the words were nearly lost to the faintness of his voice. Had the call not been on speaker, they might have gone unheard entirely.

"The last time you visited, I never got the chance to greet you properly. You..." Brenden stopped himself,biting back the question about the gossip circulating in the Curtis household. With Holley nearby, it wasn't the time to ask.

Marissa listened from her seat, her posture perfectly composed. The tone between the two struck her as unusually intimate.

"I'm fine. I only fainted because Marissa made me furious!"

The memory of that day still made Rita's chest tighten. Marissa had gone to see Rayden at the hospital, yet hadn't bothered to check on her, even though her ward was next door. That act of disregard was unforgivable.

Marissa would never have her support!

In her heart, there was only one true daughter of the family, and that was Holley.

If Marissa refused to yield, then Rita saw no reason to stay gentle.

Her features hardened as she remembered her own past. She had once triumphed over Callan, Curtis's many lovers to secure her place by his side. If she could outwit them, surely she could handle a willful girl like Marissa.

"I'm glad to hear you're well," Brenden said cautiously, hesitating before continuing. He had meant to discuss the banquet with Holley, but found himself faltering.′′|sMiss Curtis nearby, by any chance?"

"Are you ignoring me now?" Rita's tone lifted, carrying the faint edge of challenge beneath her words.

Brenden stiffened at once. With a quick motion, he signaled for the nearby staff to clear the room, the unease in his chest warring with a private eagerness to speak with her alone.

"You've got it wrong. That's not what I meant," he muttered, easing into a chair as he pulled out his work phone.Lowering his voice to a near whisper, he let a familiar warmth seep into his tone. "Honey, will you come to the party?"

The sound of that endearment drew a spark of pleasure to Rita's face. Her lips curved into a radiant smile."You actually want me to come?"

Whatever reply came from the other end, Holley couldn't make it out. She only noticed Rita rise from her seat, her tone brimming with youthful delight. "We'll be there soon."

Curiosity burned at the tip of Holley's tongue, yet she swallowed it back after seeing how happy Rita looked.

Better to stay out of it. Rita's business wasn't hers to question, and pretending not to notice felt safer.

After all, when a person was already having an affair, what difference did a few more make?

And besides, she still had her own reasons for keeping Brenden on her side.

Behind her wide, innocent eyes, thoughts churned like hidden waves.

At the banquet hall, Farris stood frozen for a brief moment before his senses kicked back in. He had a clear purpose that night-his task was to keep a sharp eye on Theodore.

More than that, Theodore had practically handed him a golden chance to stir trouble.

The thought alone made Farris's pulse quicken. If the Curtis family discovered that Theodore had shown up with a woman, chaos was bound to follow.

Everyone knew about the engagement between the Curtis and Brooks families. How could they possibly overlook such an offense?

Without wasting another second, he began firing off messages to his Curtis family connections, urging them to come and witness the unfolding drama for themselves.

Breaking into a brisk pace, Farris hurried toward the first-floor lobby and stopped beside the elevator. "Where did the person who just went in head to?" he asked one of the staff, his tone impatient.

Farris and Theodore shared blood through their mothers' side, making them cousins.

From childhood, Theodore had always carried himself with quiet confidence, his intelligence and composure setting him apart early on.

On the other hand, Farris had a streak of mischief that often landed him in trouble and kept him at odds with his cousin.

Although their ages were close,the constant comparisons from relatives created a rift between them.

No one liked being measured against someone who always seemed to come out ahead.

For Farris, it had been a bitter experience he never forgot.

Their families had always been intertwined, livingpractically next door to one another. Farris had spent his entire childhood being measured against Theodore's achievements, and now that he'd discovered a weakness, he clung to it with satisfaction.

His goal was simpole-to make sure everyone knew that Theodore was impotent.
###Chapter 96 Looking For Trouble


Since the Curtis family were the hosts, they were expected to show up before anyone else.

Since they weren't there yet and the event didn't start until eight, no one dared to comment on their absence.

Most of the guests who came early had their own motives-trying to make connections.

The truly rich and powerful, however, knew they didn't need to prove anything; they arrived exactly wwhen they wanted.

A few people had simply shown up out of curiosity, wondering why the Curtis family had decided to host a banquet out of the blue.

They were known for charity events, so most assumed this was just another one of those.

Among the early arrivals was Farris, Theodore's cousin.

At first glance, he was hard to miss-tall, strikingly handsome, and dressed in expensive designer clothes that screamed sophistication.

The moment he walked in, he caught everyone's attention, especially the women. When they noticed him scanning the crowd as if he was looking for someone, a few bold ones exchanged knowing looks and started toward him with practiced grace.

Meanwhile, one of the male staff members looked completely thrown off when Farrisstopped him with a question. With so many guests around, how was he supposed to know who Farris meant?

"Could you be more specific, sir?" the staff member asked nervously, trying not to sound rude.

Farris said impatiently,"Aman and a woman who just came in. The woman's very pretty. The man's just...ordinary."

His tone completely changed between the two descriptions. His eyes lit up when he mentioned the woman, then darkened again as he ruffled his hair in frustration. "It was only a few minutes ago. You must've seen them."

The poor staff member could feel sweat prickling at the back of his neck. A pretty woman and an ordinary man? That could describe half the guests here!

Still, he forced a polite smile and said, "The lounge is on the eighth floor, sir. I believe the guests you're referring to have gone up there."

Then,with a courteous nod, he added, "Shall I call the elevator for you?"

Farris frowned, thinking about the woman again. The lounge? At this time? The idea made his competitive streak flare. There was no way he was letting Theodore make a move before him.

Up in the lounge terrace, Brenden finished the phone call and stayed behind for a moment, sighing before he finally left.

Marissa turned off the voice recorder and sent a quick message to Benny. "Benny, look into this man."

She attached a photo she had discreetly taken of Brenden.

Within seconds, Benny called back.

At the same time, inside his office at the Hardy Group, Bryson's call went to voicemail. "The person youare calling is busy. Please leave your message..."

With a sharp bang, he slammed his phone onto the desk, making his assistant, who had just entered, tense up.

The assistant wondered what was going on. Why was Bryson upset again?

"Mr. Hardy, it's a call from your mother," he said quickly, holding out another phone.

Jenna had tried reaching Bryson directly, but since his line was busy, she called the assistant instead.

Hearing that it was his mother, Bryson's expression softened just a little. "What does she want?" he asked,loosening his tie with one hand. "She asked if you've left yet," the assistant replied, keeping his tone cautious. Jenna had also asked about Evelina, but he decided to leave that part out.

"Please hold on, Mrs. Hardy," the assistant said politely into the receiver before handing his phone over.

Bryson took the phone, his tone softening as he spoke. "Hi, Mom."

The assistant couldn't make out what was being said on the other end of the call, but he could tell from Bryson's expression that something serious had happened. Bryson's voice turned cold as he stood up from his chair. "Evelina got into a fight. Her face is injured-she probably won't make it to the banquet. I don't need a plus one. I'Il stop by the hospital to get her first."

"Should I have the car brought around?" the assistant asked carefully, watching Bryson's tightening jaw.

"Yes," Bryson said curtly, grabbing his coat and walking out without another word.

Back at the hotel, Farris's determination to find Theodore hadn't wavered one bit. The moment he stepped off the elevator on the eighth floor, he went straight to search for him.

Brenden was in the middle of giving directions to staff, trying to make sure everything was running smoothly before the banquet began. He wanted to personally welcome Rita and Holley, but with the cameras everywhere and guests starting to arrive, he had to stay focused.

"Which lounge is Theodoe in?" Farris demanded, blocking Brenden's way.

Brenden stiffened at his aggressive tone. Assuming trouble, he subtly signaled a nearby employee to call for security.

"I'm Farris Patel, Theodore's cousin," Farris quickly clarified, not wanting to cause unnecessary chaos.

Brenden relaxed slightly: He had just gotten off the phone and knew Theodore had come early with Marissa,though he wasn't sure which lounge Theodore was using. He looked over at one of his colleagues for confirmation.

"Room 8806," the colleague replied immediately.

"This way, Mr. Patel," Brenden said politely, gesturing for Farris to follow. Meanwhile, inside Room 8888, Marissa had just ended her call with Benny. As she stood up from the deck chair and glanced out toward the terrace, she spotted Theodore and Farris together.

From where she stood, she could tell Farris was clearly agitated, while Theodore remained calm and detached,his cool demeanor creating an invisible barrier between them.

Then, out of nowhere, Farris lunged forward and made a crude grab for Theodore's crotch.

Marissa's eyes flew wide as she bolted toward the railing.

Holy crap! For a split second, she wished she could grow wings and soar over there herself.

Thankfully,Theodore reacted fast. He caught Farris's arm just in time, stopping whatever foolish thing he was about to do.

Marissa turned on her heel, ready to sprint straight to Theodore's lounge, when a sharp cry echoed behind her.

"Ah!" Farris yelped.

She froze and looked back, only to see him pinned against the railing, the two locked in a position that looked far more intimate than it should have.

She blinked a few times, speechless, before finally speaking up. "You two do realize how that looks, right?"

If any reporters caught them in this position, the scene would be front-page gossip material by morning.

Across the terrace, Theodore met her gaze briefly. His expression didn't waver as he released Farris's wrist,then effortlessly tossed him onto a nearby lounge chair."Stay put and keep quiet."
###Chapter 97 He Was A Complete Airhead


"You!" Farris's face burned red with embarrassment as he peered down through the clear glass railing,breathing a sigh of relief when he didn't spot Marissa below.

"She didn't catch that, did she?" he asked nervously, not having gotten a good look at who'd called out before he'd made a complete fool of himself.

His gut told him it was probably the woman who'd come upstairs with Theodore earlier.

He hadn't even had a shot at sweeping her off her feet, and already he'd blown it-definitely not his usual smooth operator routine.

"Theodore?" Farris noticed Theodore giving him the cold shoulder, so he hauled himself up from the lounge chair, shook out his aching arm, and thick-skinned as ever, sidled over."Come on-we're family.We practically grew up in each other's pockets. How about throwing me a bone here? Let me take a crack at that woman? I'm telling you, it was love at first sight."

Theodore shot him a look, his face an unreadable mask, his tone carrying an edge of warning. "Keep your distance from her."

Farris stopped in his tracks, then eyed him with growing suspicion. Was that woman actually someone Theodore had his eye on?

"But wait-aren't you already spoken for?" Farris felt his head spinning, his hand instinctively reaching for his phone, ready to dial up his aunt.

This was heavy. Theodore was planning to cut ties with the Curtises and parade another woman around right under their noses.

Wasn't that basically throwing down.the gauntlet?
"Theodore, you can't just play with fire like this!" Farris's expression shifted, concern creeping in. He knew Theodore inside and out, and there'd never been any women in his orbit. Now suddenly one showed up out of nowhere? It seemed he was totally smitten with her.

Theodore gave him a calm, measured glance and said in an even tone, "Don't go stirring up trouble."

"I'm not stirring up anything," Farris shot back defensively, but all he heard in response was the lounge door clicking shut.

Annoyed, he ran his fingers through his hair in frustration and pulled out his phone, thinking he'd blow off steam to his friends, but then Theodore's earlier warning echoed in his mind, and he hesitated.

"Damn it!" He tossed the phone onto the sofa and threw himself down beside it, wrestling with what to do.

A tap at the door broke through his thoughts.

"Come in!" Farris figured it was room service and called out without bothering to move.

The hotel had tight security-no way could anyone get in without a room card.

After a few beats of silence, Farris muttered under his breath and dragged himself up to answer the door.

"What's wrong?Why-"

The words died on his lips as the door swung open, revealing the very woman who'd been occupying his thoughts standing right there in front of him.

Before he could stop himself, Farris swallowed hard, the sound embarrassingly loud in the quiet hallway.

The woman was stunning-her features perfectly sculpted. She looked just as surprised to see him, a flicker of confusion dancing across her face.

"You..." Farris meant to ask if she was looking for Theodore, but what came out instead was,"Hi,I'm Farris Patel. What's your name? Want to be friends?"

He stared at her eagerly, his gaze glued to her face, not daring to let his eyes wander south.

It wasn't that he didn't want to-he just didn't dare.

The woman standing before him wore no expression at all,radiating an icy coolness that could freeze water. Oh man.

He'd gone and fallen head over heels for Theodore's woman and now wanted to make his move!

"Want to come in?" Farris felt his cheeks warm, his eyes bright with hope as he pulled the lounge door open wider in invitation.

"No thanks." Marissa shot him down without hesitation.

An invitation to step into someone's room often carried more weight than just crossing a threshold.

Lillian had griped to her once about how somne guy she'd met while riding motorcycles had added her on WhatsApp and jumped to conclusions that he was her boyfriend.

Lillian had been furious-blocked him on the spot and had Benny wipe out all his social media accounts.

Even as Marissa turned him down, Farris's eyes still brimmed with puppy-dog devotion. He wasn't put off one bit, shamelessly pressing on. "Can I at least get your contact info?"

Before Marissa could reply, Farris cut in again, "Hang on a second."

Marissa figured he was going to fetch Theodore, so she turned and leaned back against the corridor wall.

Farris moved in a flash, terrified she'd bolt. Clutching his phone, his heart sank when he didn't see her right away,but then he caught the sound of the voice he'd been dying to hear.

"Where is he?" Marissa asked, seeing only Farris and no trace of Theodore anywhere.

"Huh?" Farris, looking somewhat dazed and confused, fumbled to pull out his phone. "We should exchange WhatsApp numbers! What's your name, anyway? You're gorgeous-honestly, the most beautiful girl l've ever laid eyes on. Like an angel."

For a few seconds, Marissa just looked at Farris, saying nothing. Now she understood why Theodore had told her not to pay attention to this guy. He was a complete airhead.

As Farris rambled on, he inched closer to the woman he was clearly smitten with, a goofy grin spreading across his face. They were standing side by side now, and as Farris closed the gap, Marissa found herself boxed in, her back pressed against the wall.

Marissa didn't budge an inch at his invasion of her space, crossing her arms, her whole bearing cold and commanding.

"Shameless jerk," she sneered.

Farris's eyes darkened, a flash of irritation crossing his features, but he quickly acted like he hadn't heard a thing, his interest still running strong as he kept moving in. "Hey beautiful, running into each other again must be fate. Come on, let's be friends, yeah?"

"Who do you think you are?" Marissa shot back, looking him up and down.

He didn't deserve to be in her circle-not by a long shot.

Farris's mind jumped to some unpleasant memories, his brow creasing. But just as quickly, something seemed to click, realization washing over his face as he stuck out his hand. "Hello, I'm Farris Patel,Theodore's cousin. So are you and my cousin an item? Do you know that he..."

Farris's voice trailed off, the words left dangling in the air.
###Chapter 98 Theodore, Please, Let Me Explain


A glimmer of emotion shone in Farris's eyes, hinting at unspoken words that seemed to beg for release

Marissa arched a brow, a quiet laugh slipping past her lips before she quickly stifled it. Her expression softened into a teasing half-smile. "So what if I'm seeing your cousin?" she replied lightly.

Farris hesitated for a moment, his brow furrowing, before his features relaxed, as if he had made up his mind. "I know this might sound sudden, bout..." He took a deep breath, summoning his nerve. "I fell for you the moment I saw you. I really like you. If you're only here as my cousin's date, could you give me a chance?"

His tone was sincere, his gaze filled with a blend of admiration and hope.

But Marissa, unfazed by his sudden love confession, regarded him with amnused detachment.

He looked young, though his formal attire gave him an air of false maturity.

Narrowing her eyes slightly, she studied him, then lowered her gaze, her tone turning playful."Are you trying to steal Theodore's woman?"

Her bluntness caught him off guard. He blinked, momentarily speechless, before shaking his head with a strained smile. "No, I didn't mean it like that..."

"You were about to mention his engagement, weren't you?" Marissa cut in sharply, her eyes locking onto his with deliberate intensity.

Farris faltered. "You... know about that?" he asked, frowning in confusion.

He had never seen her before, and she didn't look like someone from a powerful family.

The engagement between the Curtis and the Brooks families wasn't public knowledge.

Had Theodore ever mentioned it to her? Was he really that taken with her? A storm of questions raced through Farris's mind. If she already knew everything and still chose to stay by Theodore's side... that was something else entirely.

His eyes flickered, and a faint grin curved his lips. "Well, I'm not exactly outgoing," he admitted, feigning modesty. "Confessing my feelings to you today took all the courage I had. Normally, if I see a girl walking toward me, I cross the street to avoid her. My cousin, on the other hand, is the complete opposite-women always surround him."

"Really?" Marissa arched a brow, her tone playful. "So,you really like me?"

"I was smitten the first moment I saw you," Farris declared with earnest conviction. "You're like an angel.You and my cousin don't seem to talk much. Isn't it exhausting being with someone like him? He's bad-tempered.Do you two even have anything in common?"
Marissa's expression stayed composed, her eyes cool as she subtly noticed Theodore striding toward them with an increasingly dark look. She still played along, nodding to Farris. "We don't have much to talk about."

"I thought so," Farris said, a knowing tone creeping into his voice before he hesitated. "I mean-he is like that when he doesn't like someone... wait, I don't mean he dislikes you. I'm just worried that being with him might hurt you eventualy. He has this habit of shutting people out."

"So...are you saying he actually likes me?" Marissa's voice softened, tinged with curiosity.

Farris blinked, watching her lower her head, hands covering her face as if shy, and he panicked. "No, no! l never said that-he didn't tell me anything like that!"

Marissa dropped her hands, her gaze clear yet accusing. "You're lying, aren't you?"

"Of course not!" Farris protested, eyes lighting up with excitement as he leaned in slightly. "I just don't want you getting tricked by him. Why not choose me instead? I'll make you laugh. I'm way better than that cold cousin of mine."

"Would you really treat me better than he does?" Marissa's words came out soft, almost a whisper.

Farris took that as encouragement and stepped closer, his confidence growing as his hand moved toward her leg."Of course.I would treat you a thousand times better." Marissa's sudden laugh shattered the moment. "Shouldn't you ask your cousin about that first?"

Farris froze, every nerve in his body tightening as realization hit him. His back stiffened, and sweat began to bead on his forehead.

A chilling voice cut through the air behind him. "Did you think I was joking when I warned you?"

Theodore's cold words made Farris's blood run cold. A strong hand clamped onto his shoulder, jerking him upright. "You've got some nerve touching my woman."

Farris's face drained of color. His woman?

He turned to Marissa in disbelief, searching her expression for a sign that this was some sort of misunderstanding.

But she was still leaning casually against the wall, her lips curved into a knowing smile, eyes gleaming with quiet amusement.

Realization hit Farris like a slap. "You set me up?" he shouted, his voice trembling with frustration. "You knew he was coming and said those words on purpose!"

Marissa's gaze turned glacial, her tone sharp yet languid. "Weren't you the one who said you liked me?"

Hearing this, Theodore's grip on Farris tightened, his glare cutting deep enough to make Farris flinch.

Pain shot through Farris's shoulder, tears welling in his eyes as he struggled to speak. "Um, Theodore,please, let me explain..."

But Theodore didn't listen. He yanked him back harshly.
###Chapter 99 He's Not Worth Taking Seriously


Theodore's grip was like iron.

Caught flat-footed, Farris stumbled, nearly losing his footing, and had to slap his hand against the wall to keep himself upright.

He hadn't expected to get busted red-handed.

Out in public, Farris had the guts to mouth off at Theodore, banking on the fact that Theodore, who cared about keeping up appearances, wouldn't come down on him too hard.

But now, with not a soul around, Farris felt his stomach drop. When push came to shove, he was still pretty spooked by this stone-faced, intimidating figure.

Wincing visibly, Farris steadied himself, clutching his right shoulder with his left hand and resting his right hand on his hip, grumbling under his breath,"You're about to snap my collarbone like a twig! Couldn't you just tell me to back off instead of manhandling me?"

His voice dropped so low it was barely a whisper.

Marissa watched his shifting expressions with detached patience, noting how his muttering got quieter and quieter. She lowered her gaze and looked away.

"Do you like her?" Theodore's finger pointed toward Marissa, but his words were aimed squarely at Farris."Look at me!"

Farris snapped his eyes to Theodore, taking in that blank expression. His heart hammered in his chest, and he forced out a smile that couldn't have looked less genuine if he tried, shaking his head like his life depended on it. "No way! I was just testing her for you, to see if she really gives a damn about you. I am not interested in her. Theodore, you've got to believe me! I'm being straight with you!"

Worried Theodore might not buy it, he added, "I was running the test from the second you walked through that door." He even dragged Theodore's mother into it, convinced that Marissa was just some girl from humble beginnings. "Your mother even said you could marry whoever you want. It doesn't have to be someone from the Curtis family!"

Marissa let out a quiet scoff.

He actually called that a test?

"Theodore, he said you'd give me the cold shoulder." Marissa spoke softly, her tone landing somewhere between a complaint and a tease, a ghost of a smile tugging at her lips. "He said you were swimming in beautiful women."

She looked up, catching his gaze dead-on, her eyes still glinting with amusement.

Theodore didn't break eye contact, staring right back at her, his eyes gradually warming with a real smile.

"I didn't say that! You're making stuff up!" Farris burst out, his eyes going wide with disbelief as he gaped at Marissa, his mouth twitching as he fought to keep his expression in check-smiling with his lips, but his eyes burning with resentment. "Miss, you can't just throw accusations around like that. We're complete strangers -why on earth would I say anything like that to you?"

Farris was hell-bent on not admitting a thing.

As long as he denied it, Theodore would take his word over hers.

Still, Farris felt his confidence waver, his brow furrowing, not daring to meet anyone's eyes head-on, his shoulder still throbbing.

Theodore's brutal grip on his shoulder just now brought back memories of when Theodore had beaten him senseless as a kid-no mercy whatsoever.

Just thinking about it sent a cold chill down his spine.
Left wvith no other choice, Farris played his trump card: he brought up Theodore's mother again. "Theodore,this is all one big misunderstanding. Your mother just wanted me to find out where you got hurt."

He wasn't lying through his teeth-it really was his aunt who'd told him about Theodore's injury. She'd even suspected his injury was somewhere... delicate, given how he'd dragged his feet on agreeing to the marriage alliance with the Curtis family before, and now suddenly gave it the green light.

Anyone would jump to that conclusion!

Besides, he was getting paid to do this job, and he had to deliver,right?

He just hadn't counted on Theodore bringing a woman to the party-especially to a Curtis family banquet.

Feeling a bit bolder now, Farris pressed on, "Theodore, if you've got a problem with it, take it up with your mother, not me. I'm just the messenger here-I don't know anything!"

With that, he took off like a shot, vanishing around the corner.

He didn't go far though, stopping just out of sight to catch his breath before carefully peeking back down the hallway.

There they were-Marissa and Theodore locked in a silent staring match.

Marissa leaned casually against the wall, arms folded, looking deceptively harmless despite that icy exterior,but the truth was anything but.

Theodore radiated coldness, the kind that kept people at arm's length.

The two stood there facing each other.

Farris noted that neither one was budging an inch.

Just from looks alone, they seemed like a perfect match.

The air hung heavy with silence.

After a few beats, Farris pulled up a chat with his aunt and fired off a short video clip.

Marissa glanced toward the corner, raising an eyebrow at Theodore. "Your cousin is quite the character."

Theodore didn't rush to Farris's defense, instead pulling Marissa closer with an arm draped around her shoulder, a hint of a smile tugging at his lips. "He's not worth taking seriously. If you run into him again, don't bother being polite. Don't feel like you need to spare his feelings on my account."

Theodore went on calmly, "Lashing out at him wouldn't be crossing any lines. Did he get under your skin earlier? He didn't get very far."

He dropped his gaze, his eyes fixed entirely on her.

To Theodore, Farris was small fry.

Marissa's voice stayed even, as if she was above it all. "Something that petty doesn't get to me."

Theodore's lips quirked up slightly, not pushing the conversation any further.
###Chapter 100 It Seems They're Getting Along Perfectly Fine


Theodore's chest felt broad and radiated warmth, and as Marissa moved closer, a faint aroma of cedar mixed with the clean, sharp scent of mnedicinal herbs drifted from him.

His attire was flawless, tailored to perfection, and since Marissa didn't have the luxury of x-ray vision, she couldn't discern where he might be hurt. He didn't move like a man in pain either, and that made her hesitate. For a brief second, she considered slipping her hand away from his grasp-but after a pause, she decided against it.

Since fate had already tied her to Theodore, he belonged to her.

So what harm was there in a simple hug?

Surely, it would be too dull to have only a title while living a restrained, overly proper life.

For Marissa, once she desired something, she made sure it became hers.

Luckily for her, Theodore didn't resist. He wasn't the kind of man who needed to be coaxed or cornered;he yielded willingly to her touch.

From his position in the corner, Farris watched the scene unfold, jealousy eating away at him.

His earlier comments hadn't been entirely false; he truly had developed feelings for Marissa. She was exactly his type. She was cool on the surface and soft underneath. All his past girlfriends had shared that same dual nature-cold at first glance, but tender and compliant once you got close.

Years of romantic experience had sharpened Farris's ability to read women, and he was certain Theodore's woman fit that mold perfectly.

The contrast in her nature only made her more appealing, especially now, nestled sweetly against Theodore's chest. She was even more his kind of temptation.

And he had a particular weakness for women who already belonged to someone else. With a flicker of mischief in his eyes, Farris lowered his gaze and tapped out a message to his friends, telling them to bring a few girls along... and a little something extra,too.

"Do you want to go downstairs for a bit?" Theodore's low voice broke the silence. Tilting his head slightly, he looked down at her, his hand still resting on her shoulder as he drew her subtly closer.

"It's rather dull here," Marissa admitted, her tone tinged with regret.
Looking back, she thought she would have been better off staying in the lab a little longer. Or she could have gone to the Fletcher Group to settle a few pending matters instead of wasting time at this social event.

Hearing her reply, Theodore gently steered her toward the lounge. "Then let's get out of here," he suggested.

Just as Marissa was about to agree, her phone rang-a video call from Corrine.

She didn't release Theodore's hand, and when they sat on the sofa, she remained tucked comfortably in his arms while answering the call.

On the screen, Corrine appeared beside Andrew.

"Mom. Andrew." Marissa greeted them politely.

"Marissa." Corrine smiled, though her expression shifted as her gaze caught sight of the hand draped over Marissa's shoulder.

It was a man's hand!

From Corrine's perspective, she could only make out the man's strong jawline and his naturally commanding presence.

Her daughter had a boyfriend?

Corrine hesitated, pretending not to.notice while silently preparing herself to bring up the idea of ending the engagement. Thankfuly, she hadn't officially mentioned the arrangement to Marissa yet.

She exhaled softly. Truth be told, she had always admired Theodore for his maturity, his composure, and the fact he never messed around with other women.

Part of her didn't want him to marry someone else.

Not even Holley had been her first choice. Even when Holley had pleaded tearfully that she couldn't live without Theodore,Corrine had remained firm in her stance.

Lost in her thoughts, Corrine suddenly heard a calm, familiar male voice on the phone. "Mrs. Curtis."

Her eyes widened in disbelief. Had Marissa already introduced her family to her boyfriend?

Heart pounding,Corrine focused on the screen.

For a moment, she thought her eyes were deceiving her. Blinking, she asked uncertainly,′′|sthat...Theodore?"

As she looked closer, realization struck-the man holding her daughter was indeed Theodore himself.

Theodore offered a small,polite smile.′′YeS.′′

Relieved, Corrine chose not to pry further, not wanting to embarrass them. She simply mentioned that she and Andrew would arrive soon before ending the call.

"Mom, was that Theodore?" Andrew asked, his handsome face betraying his surprise. Seeing the two of them together, even through a screen, had caught him completely off guard.

Their relationship was moving at lightning speed!

Still smiling to herself, Corrine replied, "Yes, it was him. He's with your sister-they seem to be getting along quite well. We shouldn't interrupt them when we arrive. Let them have their time together. Who knows?They could be getting married and having a baby sooner than we think."

Andrew sighed, rubbing his forehead. His mother was already jumping ahead of things, but given how fast his sister and Theodore were progressing, the thought wasn't entirely unrealistic.

He stroked his chin. "Theodore actually smiled just now."

It had been ages since he had seen Theodore smile genuinely-not the polite kind he wore in public, but a real one.

The video had ended too soon for him to see Marissa's expression. In Andrew's eyes, gentle women like his sister were easily overwhelmed by assertive men like Theodore-just like Holley, who had been under Theodore's quiet influence since childhood.

The thought of Holley made his brow crease. He could only hope she wouldn't stir up trouble out of jealousy.

"That's great to hear," Corrine said softly, a touch of contentment in her voice. "Theodore isn't the type to express emotion easily, and your sister isn't particularly lively either. I was worried she might be upset about the engagement."

Announcing Marissa's engagement to Theodore immediately upon returning home was a rash move-one that even Corrine found abrupt.

"But it seems they're getting along perfectly fine." With that, Corrine typed a message to Rayden,who was still recovering in the hospital, eager to share the good news.
