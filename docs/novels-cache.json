    "description": "Lyric had spent her life being hated. Bullied for her scarred face and hated by everyone-including her own mate-she was always told she was ugly. Her mate only kept her around to gain territory, and the moment he got what he wanted, he rejected her, leaving her broken and alone. Then, she met him. The first man to call her beautiful. The first man to show her what it felt like to be loved. It was only one night, but it changed everything For Lyric, he was a saint, a savior. For him, she was the only woman that had ever made him cum in bed-a problem he had been battling for years. Lyric thought her life would finally be different, but like everyone else in her life, he lied. And when she found out who he really was, she realized he wasn't just dangerous-he was the kind of man you don't escape from. Lyric wanted to run. She wanted freedom. But she desired to navigate her way and take back her respect, to rise above the ashes.\nEventually,she was forced into a dark world she didn't wish to get involved with",

    "description": "One year into marriage, Yvonne realized she was nothing more than a substitute for someone else memory. When his true love reappeared, Julian tossed a divorce contract her way. \"She's back. We're finished,\" he said flatly. The secret of her pregnancy stayed hidden Yvonne fought the urge to cry, signed her freedom, and disappeared Five years on, cameras flashed as Yvonne, radian in red, strode across a film festival stage with her bright-eyed son. Julian's hands clenched as he watched. \"Sir, the boy's four and a half,\" whispered his shaken assistant. Then, he rushed to the film set only to witness an A-list actor gently wrapping his arm around Yvonne's waist. \"I've booked your favorite restaurant for tonight's celebration.\"\nThe little boy blinked his innocent eyes at Julian, asking,\"Who are you? One of my mom's crazy admirers?\" He cornered her in the dressing room, his voice hoarse as he said,\"Let's remarry.\" Her lips curled slightly, but the smile didn't reach her eyes.\"The curtain's down; it's time to end this scene.\" But this time, he wasn't letting go.",
